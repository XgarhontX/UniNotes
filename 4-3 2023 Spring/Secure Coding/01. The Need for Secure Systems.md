# Self-reproducing Programs
- Worms (self-replicating program that spreads over network via lack of security measures -- too much privilege)
- Viruses (a program that attaches itself to an executable program and activates when that executable is run -- it looks for other executables to attach itself to so it can spread -- also takes advantage of too much privilege)
- Trojans (a program that hides inside another and can do things underneath without you knowing -- takes advantage ofÂ too much privilege)
# Honeypot
- Car bait type beat.
- An isolated & monitored computer security mechanism to bait and catch hackers and find vulnerability.
	- Usually placed between the internet and the actual network, pretending to be that actual network.

# Secure Products
- Quality
- Well Tested
- Robust
- Fails Securely
	- On crash, gracefully crash or at least try.
	- Save on crash, Disclose as little info as possible, Don't effect system.
# Attack VS Defend
- Attackers can probe for unknown weaknesses, choosing what is the weakest.
	- Can play dirty
- Defender have to defend all points, and can't really defend against unknown weaknesses.
