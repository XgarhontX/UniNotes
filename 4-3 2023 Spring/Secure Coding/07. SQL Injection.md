# Definition
- Attacker gives SQL input that modifies the query.
	- Simplest Attack: If Defender concatenates Strings to create queries.
# Java Example

	- Major L concatenating Strings
	- 0 OR 1=1 will make 1=1 evaluate to true, return everything in the table queried
# Mitigation
- DON'T BUILD QUERY STRING WITH CONCATONATION
	- Use Parameterized Queries, which checks and "concatenate" for you.
- Scrub input
	- If you expect an int, force to be an int.
	- Allow list input validation: look at data entered and provide appropriate value
	- Escape input with DB specific character encoding (use this only when nothing else is possible)
## Java Mitigation
- Use PreparedStatement which escapes non-query values, which won't get executed by DBMS.
