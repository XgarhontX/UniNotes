# The Right Way
- Password is hashed w/ a salt.
	- SHA, RipeMD, WHIRLPOOL
	- Collisions are not common at all, cryptographic hashing is designed to be evenly distributed.
- Add encryption for end to end too.
- Don't store String of non-hashed password.
# Lookup Table
- Database of hashes mapped to password strings
- Your common profanity password is easily looked up
## Salt
- Instead of hashing just the password, do
	- hash(password + "28jtH68h2ioaQJ")
		- or whatever random String you fancy
- This will throw Lookup Tables off
	- Making a salt for each user makes it very difficult, so that a lookup table can't adapt to new user if past one is guessed.
	- Make it a longer String too (same length of hash output length), mega aids to guess.
# Poor Hashing
- Don't chain hashing.
- Though it is longer to crack, there is always a way your source code is revealed.
# Hash Collision
- It is very rare
- Someone can try to attack with collision, but it's very hard.
