# Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- When the webservice doesn't scrub the data for itself.
- Like SQL injection, attackers can give malicious JavaScript as input instead of complying, making the server execute crap.
## Types
- Persistent XSS: originates from the site's database, so attacker stored it their.
- Reflected XSS: originates from victim's request.
- DOM-based XSS: vulnerability in clientside. 
## Basic Attacks
- `<div> $varUnsafe </div>`
	- Attacker can place their HTML headers there, e.g. `<script> alert('hi') </script>`
- In CSS variables
- In JavaScript variables
## Mitigation
- JavaScript writing to HTML, force using escape characters for things like <, >, \$, etc.
# Cross-site Request Forgery (CSFR)
- Steal victim's identity (blindly) and make victim send malicious requests.
	- When the victim is logged in (auto logged in session token, jwt be like) and attacker forges request, it is hard to detect if that is the actual user
- Common attack is a fake email to victim.
	- Or even embedding a malicious URL in the src of a picture.
## Mitigation
- Don't auto load all info of emails/documents
- Extremely short jwt expiry
- Don't use GET URL w/ query for sensitive info
