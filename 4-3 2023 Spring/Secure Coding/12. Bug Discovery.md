# Fuzzing
- Test edge cases, and beyond.
## However, how do we now when we have tested enough?
- There is a 0.0001% to crash a pdf viewer from changing a byte in a .pdf
- Similar with a video file.
- These takes quite a lot of test cases to find.
## Measurements
- Line Coverage
	- Does test cases exec all lines?
- Branch Coverage
	- Does test cases reach all ends & iterations of if-else/switch branches & loops?
- Path Coverage (Hardest)
	- Does the test cases reach all paths/optional conditionals?
	- Infeasible Paths
		-  ![[Pasted image 20230512102813.png|60]]
- These test cases add up to a lot.
	- Some bugs can't be found even with full coverage
## American Fuzzy Lop
- ![[Pasted image 20230522100053.png|320]]
	- AFL automate fuzzing by randomly creating input trying to reach all paths of the program
		- Give it in and out folders for logging
		- Let it run cycles
	- Requires source code.
		- Compile with the AFL debug tools, allowing it to detect paths taken by program
	- Will generate inputs
		- Text
		- Image
		- etc.

# Manual Analysis
## Third Party
- Libraries can be a security risk. It is a security risk long-term.
## Binary Analysis
- Aids, look at assembly/byte
# States
