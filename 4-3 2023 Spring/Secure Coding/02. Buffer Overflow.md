# Basics of the Attack
- "Smashing the (call) stack"
	- String buffer (an array of characters) is overwritten to the point where the **return address** of the current stack frame is **overwritten** and the program is then redirected to a malicious payload.
 - Exploit specific to C
	- Languages that allow memory management w/o bounds checking allows for this exploit.
	- i.e. strcpy, strcat, sprintf, gets
		- strcpy will indiscriminately copy from a source to destination, regardless of bounds. So, if the source length is bigger, easy.
## Why Dangerous?
- Most OS, compilers, interpreter are written in C because of how low level it is.
- Can allow for Tampering, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege
# Stack-based Overruns
## Stack Frame Layout
- ![[Pasted image 20230403103907.png|200]]
	- Local variable is lower address than return, making it accessible with things like strcpy.
## Using strcpy
- ![[Pasted image 20230403104009.png|250]]
	- We override the buffer, the return jmp address, then add in a NOP "sled", then the payload.
		- The NOP sled allows for the Attacker to have leniency in specifying the return jmp address.
# Mitigation
- Canaries
	- A value placed on stack frame between local variables and return address
		- Inserted by modern C compilers
	- On return, check if return address is the same as the canary.
		- If not, exit (which is denial of service, which is better than elevation of privilege)
- Reverse order of stack layout so that return address comes before local variables
	- Not practical, must recompile everything.
- OS & CPU protects
	- Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
		- Randomize location of memory to make return address jumping harder.
		- Windows randomizes where .dll files are loaded.
- Validated inputs, check bounds
- Don't use strcpy
	- C++
	- strsafe.h
- Don't use C if possible
# Heap Based Overruns
- Similar to stack.
	- Can overwrite another dynamically allocated variable.
		- e.g. A File name to a payload, or read privilege info
- Harder, since the heap is more messy than stack.
# Integer Overflow
- Attackers can overflow integers to break branching.
	- e.g. exploit if branching thinking it's always positive
		- solution: find the possible range of the value, then check range.
			- "long result = (long) int1 + (long) int2" and check range
			- "long result += int1; long result += int2;" then check range
- CPUs have carry & overflow flags for programs to check overflow.
## Advice
- Don't mix data types if possible.
- C compiler
	- Watch out, a long can be assigned to an int.
	- use -werror or -pedantic to make warnings be errors.
- Double Comparison in Java
	- "if (Math.abs(double1 - double2) < 0.00000000001)"
	- This allows some error for underflow
