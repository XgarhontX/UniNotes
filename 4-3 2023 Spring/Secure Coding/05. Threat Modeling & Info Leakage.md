# Threat Modeling
- Analyze your app to find treats
	- UML class diagram, state diagram, data flow diagram can be used as threat model
- Then use STRIDE to categorize
	- Spoofing: Pretend to be legit
	- Tampering: Modifying data
	- Repudiation: Falsify transaction
	- Info Disclosure: Protected data is viewable & leaked
	- Denial of Service: Break app or overload service
	- Elevation of Privilege: Becoming admin (biggest uh oh)
## Threat Trees
- Threat: Potential attack event
- Vulnerability: Weakness like flaw or bug
- Attack: A threat in action
## Ranking Threat
- DREAD (Score each with scale e.g. 1-10)
	- Damage Potential: How much damage is possible?
	- Reproducibility: How easy to repeat?
	- Exploitability: Amount of effort to attack?
	- Affected users: Percentage of users affected?
	- Discoverability: How fast could attack find this threat?
	- TOTAL: Find avg
- Use DREAD to find which threat to mitigate first. Pull up the low hanging fruit.
## Responding
- Do nothing
- Tell users
- Remove the thing causing problem
- Fix the problem
# Threat Mitigation Techniques List
- Spoofing
	- Authentication
	- Protect secret data
	- Don't store secrets
- Tampering
	- Authorization
	- Hashes
	- Message authentication codes
	- Digital signatures
	- Tamper-resistant protocol
- Repudiation
	- Digital signature
	- Time stamps
	- Audit trails
- Info Disclosure
	- Authorization
	- Privacy-enhanced protocols
	- Encryption
	- Protect secrets
	- Don't store secrets
- Denial of Service
	- Authentication
	- Authorization
	- Filtering
	- Throttling
	- Quality of service
- Elevation of privilege
	- Run with least privilege
# Data Flow Diagram
- ![[Pasted image 20230428095802.png|300]]
	- Input and Output is aka Flow
	- System is aka Function
	- Customer is aka I/O
		- Convention to draw them at edge.
- e.g. 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230428095832.png|420]]
		- Rounded Rectangle = Circle = Oval = Function/System

- e.g. 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230501102124.png|500]]
- Abuse Case
	- A step by step explanation of an attack or a feature that got misused to attack.
		- Use Case is correct usage.
	- Your threat model should help you identify some.
## Errors
### No Output
- ![[Pasted image 20230501103714.png|300]]
	- How is the Web Server getting the data to send to Customer?
### Data Sink
- ![[Pasted image 20230501103558.png|300]]
	- No Customers, who is using this?
### No Functions
- ![[Pasted image 20230501103930.png|70]]
	- Can't flow without function in between.
## Process
1. Make Diagrams
2. Identify Threats
	- STRIDE
	- ![[Pasted image 20230501104108.png|200]] ![[Pasted image 20230501104147.png|250]]
3. Mitigate
4. Verify Mitigation
5. Repeat
