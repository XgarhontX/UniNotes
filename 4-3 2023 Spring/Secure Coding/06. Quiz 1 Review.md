# Highlights of Ken Thompson paper (Reflections on Trusting Trust)
- Don't trust code
	- Stuff you didn't fully write
	- Input
- Showed C worm / self reproducing program
# Virus, worm, trojan
- Worms: self replicating program that spreads.
- Viruses: a program that attaches to as many executing program and spreads.
- Trojans (a program that hides inside another and can do things underneath without you knowing -- takes advantage ofÂ too much privilege)
# Principle of least privilege
- Make your program run with the minimum privileges to prevent attack from elevated privileges.
# Buffer overflow
## basics of attack
- Exploit some function of the program with a buffer (e.g. C String copy) to overwrite memory.
	- The common one is overwriting the stack, specifically the return address.
## stack frame layout

### strcpy usage
- ![[Pasted image 20230403104009.png|250]]
	- Strcpy starts from Local Variables and writes downwards. Overflow it to change the return address.
## protections (compiler level, OS level, code alternatives)
- C Compiler
	- Canaries: A value to verify return address authenticity placed between local variables and return address in same stack frame.
	- Swap Local Variable and Return Address blocks (impractical): Swapping them makes it so overflow can't reach upwards to return address. Impractical as everything must be recompiled.
	- Validate Bounds: array out of bounds be like.
- OS & CPU
	-  Address Space Layout Randomization: Randomize location of memory to make return address jumping harder.
# Integer overflow
- Overflow integers to change/break branching.
	- e.g. A branch expecting only positive values
		- A negative value from overflow will crash the program.
## protection
- CPU: Has carry flag that programming language that use to catch overflow.
- Coding: Cast integers to longs, add longs, then check to integer range.
# Regular expressions
## basic symbols
- Start of Match: ^ 
- End of Match: $
- Match includes characters a to z & 1,2,3,4,5: \[a-z.12345\]
- Match all other characters except a to z: \[^a-z\]
- Optionally Once Quantifier: ?
- Optional of Any Length Quantifier: \*
- 1-or-More Quantifier: +
- n-to-m Count Quantifier: {n,m}
- Up to m Count Quantifier: {,m}
- n or More Count Quantifier: {n,}
- ?(=)
## how to use in Java (Pattern and Matcher classes)
- Patter pattern = pattern.compile("REGEX_STRING", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE);
- Matcher matcher = patern.matcher("STRING_TO_MATCH")
- matcher.find() //eats the next found match and stores it, return boolean of success
# Java's Scanner class to help scrub input
- 
# STRIDE and DREAD
## STRIDE: Threat Identification
- Spoofing
	- Authentication
	- Protect secret data
	- Don't store secrets
- Tampering
	- Authorization
	- Hashes
	- Message authentication codes
	- Digital signatures
	- Tamper-resistant protocol
- Repudiation
	- Digital signature
	- Time stamps
	- Audit trails
- Info Disclosure
	- Authorization
	- Privacy-enhanced protocols
	- Encryption
	- Protect secrets
	- Don't store secrets
- Denial of Service
	- Authentication
	- Authorization
	- Filtering
	- Throttling
	- Quality of service
- Elevation of privilege
	- Run with least privilege
## DREAD: Threat Level Rating
- DREAD (Score each with scale e.g. 1-10)
	- Damage Potential: How much damage is possible?
	- Reproducibility: How easy to repeat?
	- Exploitability: Amount of effort to attack?
	- Affected users: Percentage of users affected?
	- Discoverability: How fast could attack find this threat?
	- TOTAL: Find avg
- Use DREAD to find which threat to mitigate first. Pull up the low hanging fruit.
# Passwords
## cryptographically secure salt and hash
- Don't write your own, because it's too 5head.
- Hash
	- Generates a fixed length "fingerprint" from data of any length.
	- Password is String to hashed String.
- Salt
	- A random String
		- Same length as the hash output, or else a lookup table can be built if short
	- Used by concatenating it with the password String, then hashing that.
		- Mitigates reverse lookup tables.
		- (Extra) Creatively concatenate it, possibly further throwing off reverse lookup table
## how to properly deal with them
- For each user on registration
	1. Send the password string securely to server
	2. Generate and store the salt of the user
	3. Generate and store the hash of the user from the password string and salt
	4. (Extra) Return to the user a hashed token to verify
- For each user during login
	1. Send the password String to server
	2. Generate the hash from the password String and the user's salt
	3. Check if the new hash matches what is stored
