# Dealing with Inputs
- Make a checklist of requirements for input.
- Using Regex can check for input, by checking strings.
	- You don't have to use regex, but it is much easier with.
# Generic Regex
- ![[Pasted image 20230410103436.png|400]]
	- {n,m} is both INCLUSIVE
	- Symbols have different meaning in different context
		- ^ is different when inside \[\]
	- \[A-z\]
		- This will include ASCII chars from A to z, which includes \[, \], \\, \`, etc.. 
		- So be careful because you probably don't want them.
## Examples

	- Filename check
		- \\w is a word character
## Java
- Pattern: [Pattern (Java SE 17 & JDK 17) (oracle.com)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html)
- You have to "\\" escape to store regex in string, like normal.
# Quantifiers
- ![[Pasted image 20230412102445.png|300]]
	- Greedy grab the whole string first, check if matches, then drop last char and repeat.
	- Reluctant starts at beginning and eat one char at a time looking for a match.
	- Possessive grab the whole and tries only once to match.
# Capturing Group
- A way to treat multiple characters as a single unit.
- e.g., The regular expression `(dog)` creates a single group containing the letters `"d" "o"` and `"g"`
- e.g. `((A)(B(C)))` has 4 groups
	- `((A)(B(C)))`
	- `(A)`
	- `(B(C))`
	- `(C)`
- Groups beginning with `(?` are pure, _non-capturing groups_ that do not capture text and do not count towards the group total.
## Backreference
- The section of the input string matching the capturing group(s) is saved in memory for later recall via _backreference_.
- Specified as a backslash (`\`) followed by a digit indicating the number of the group to be recalled.
- e.g. `(\d\d)\1`
	- `1212` matches because `12` matches each other
	- `1234` won't match
# Boundary Matches
- ![[Pasted image 20230417095947.png|320]]
- e.g. `^dog$` looks for exactly `dog`, nothing else.
- e.g. `\bdog\b`
	- Yes: The dog plays in the yard.
	- No: The doggie plays in the yard.
		- But `\bdog\B` will match
