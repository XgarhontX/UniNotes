# Why SQL?
- Very high level language
	- You don't have to worry about how the DBMS manages database.
# SELECT
- Classic
- ![[Pasted image 20230508141609.png|250]]      ![[Pasted image 20230508142948.png|150]]
	- Instead of WHERE, you can use "JOIN" & "ON" inside "FROM" to achieve the same.
		- i.e. \<table1\> JOIN \<table2\> ON \<condition\>
	- A Column can be renamed using "AS" after declaring it in "SELECT"
		- i.e. \<column1\> as \<column_renamed\>
	- "GROUP BY" after "WHERE" allows grouping rows
		- e.g. returns a table counting amount Customer from a country
			- ![[Pasted image 20230508145027.png|220]] 
	- You can add "ORDER BY" at the end, which returns table sorted by a specified column
		- e.g. also sort by Count(CustomerID)
			- ![[Pasted image 20230508145231.png|210]]
	- "SELECT", "FROM", "WHERE" can take in queries.
	- "WHERE" and "IN"
		- e.g. selects all customer with ID 1, 2, or 3

## Selecting Specific Columns on a Table
- ![[Pasted image 20230510133824.png|300]]
	- SKU & SKU_Description will be gone in resulting table (Projection)
### Distinct
- Distinct will remove duplicates (as rational algebra intented)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230510134126.png|300]]
## SELECT: \*
- ![[Pasted image 20230510134431.png|200]]
	- It just returns all.
	- Extra: in this case, distinct will not matter as there are no duplicates
### "Get all the data for products in the water sports department."
- ![[Pasted image 20230510134804.png|200]]
### "Get all data for order items and display them in order number order.  Order items with the same order number should be sorted by price."
- ![[Pasted image 20230510135250.png|200]]
- By default, ORDER BY is ascending, but we can override it
	- ![[Pasted image 20230510135508.png|200]]
## WHERE: AND
- ![[Pasted image 20230510135946.png|200]]
## WHERE: OR
- ![[Pasted image 20230510140019.png|200]]
## WHERE: IN
- ![[Pasted image 20230510140058.png|200]]
	- Will return only rows with the buyer as Nany, Cindy, or Jerry
## WHERE: Creating a range
- ![[Pasted image 20230510140658.png|200]] 
	- Same
		- ![[Pasted image 20230510140733.png|170]]
## WHERE: LIKE & Wildcards
- ![[Pasted image 20230510140832.png|200]]
	- Some scuffed REGEX
### "Get all data for products purchased by someone whose name starts with 'Pete'
- ![[Pasted image 20230510140942.png|200]]
### "Get all data for products whose description contains ‘Tent’"
- ![[Pasted image 20230510141042.png|200]]
### "Get all data for products whose sku ends in 2xx"
- ![[Pasted image 20230510141224.png|200]]
## SELECT: Renaming Attributes
- Via "AS"
	- ![[Pasted image 20230510141805.png|200]]
## SELECT: w/ Arithmetic
- ![[Pasted image 20230510142142.png|200]]
## SELECT: w/ Aggregate
- ![[Pasted image 20230510142347.png|200]] -> ![[Pasted image 20230510142433.png|100]]
### List of Built in Aggregates
- ![[Pasted image 20230510142410.png|200]]
## SELECT: w/ COUNT
- ![[Pasted image 20230510142525.png|200]] --> ![[Pasted image 20230510142536.png|100]]
	- Simply counts number of rows
### "How many departments are there?"
- ![[Pasted image 20230510142755.png|300]] --> ![[Pasted image 20230510142811.png|100]]
	- We need DISTINCT, else COUNT will indiscriminately count those non-NULL rows.
## GROUP BY 
### "List each buyer and the number of products they are responsible for purchasing."
- ![[Pasted image 20230510144413.png|250]] -->![[Pasted image 20230510144426.png|150]]
### "List each buyer, their department, and the number of products they are responsible for purchasing."
- ![[Pasted image 20230510144712.png|270]] --> ![[Pasted image 20230510144722.png|200]]
### Crazy Example
- ![[Pasted image 20230510144840.png|300]] --> ![[Pasted image 20230510145118.png|200]]
## Aggregate 
- ![[Pasted image 20230510150233.png|300]]
#### HAVING
- HAVING is a condition put on the GROUP BY table
	- This is how we can exclude groups with only 1 product count.
	- ![[Pasted image 20230510145219.png|200]]
## Subqueries
- ![[Pasted image 20230510145344.png|300]]
	- From the subquery, it returns a table (list of Water Sport department rows with a SKU column), which gets In with the other table from the primary query.
## Querying Multiple Tables: JOIN
- ![[Pasted image 20230510145747.png|400]] --> ![[Pasted image 20230510145801.png|150]]
	 - FROM those 2 tables were implicitly JOINed, which is the big table here.
### 2+ Tables
- ![[Pasted image 20230510150646.png|350]]
## Alias
- Renaming the subquery table
- ![[Pasted image 20230510150712.png|300]]
## Natural Join
- ![[Pasted image 20230510150846.png|300]]
	- Natural Join is done with equality with same column names.
### OUTERJOINs
- ![[Pasted image 20230510151111.png|200]] ![[Pasted image 20230510151124.png|180]] ![[Pasted image 20230510151148.png|180]]  ![[Pasted image 20230510151230.png|190]]  ![[Pasted image 20230510151245.png|190]]
# CREATE VIEW
- Function type beat
- ![[Pasted image 20230510151501.png|400]]
	- DBMS exec this VIEW on call and also caches the result.
		- If there are no changes, ez reuse.
		- If there are changes, DBMS smartly reuse the cached table, incrementally update/appending the cache instead of rerunning the whole query of the VIEW.
			- This is a research field called Materialized Views
# TOP 1 ORDER BY vs MAX() Performance
- TOP 1 is tie time complexity with MAX()
	- This is because of partial sorting.
	- TOP k = O(k) as quicksort brings the max/min to the front, creating the partial
