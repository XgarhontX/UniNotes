# The Data Model
- A Data Model
	- A plan or blueprint for database design
- We start with
	- Entities and their attributes/identifiers
	- Relationships
	- Business Logic
- A good design should be 1:1 correlation to an implementation
# E-R Model
- Entity-Relationship Model, a set of concepts and graphical symbols
	- An Entity is an Attribute with one or more Relationships.
- You can model it like a list (aka Extended E-R Model) (see Example below). 
	- Historically, people drew it as a mind map web type beat. It sucks, too big.
- Naming Convention
	- Entity: ALL_CAPS
	- Attributes: CamelCase
## Example
- Entity: CUSTOMER
	- CustomerNumber
	- CustomerName
	- Street
	- City
	- State
	- Zip
	- ContactName
	- Email
- Question: Say, the CustomerNumber is made up for an instance. Why make it up, and not use something like a Social Security Number?
	- Security.
# Identifiers
- Identifiers: entity attributes that name or identify entity instances.
	- If the identifier is unique between all instances, it is a Super Key.
- Composite Identifiers: identifiers consisting of 2+ attributes.
- Identifiers in data models become the keys in database designs
	- Entities have identifiers while tables/relations have keys.
# Relationship
- Relationship Degree
	- Binary Relationship
		- EMPLOYEE connects to SKILL
	- Ternary Relationship
		- CLIENT connects to PROJECTS & ARCHITECT
	- etc.
- Cardinality Relationships
	- 1-to-1 \[1:1\]
		- e.g. Badge_Assignment: EMPLOYEE --- (1:1) --- BADGE
	- 1-to-Many \[1:M\]
		- aka Parent-Child Relationship
		- e.g. Computer_Assignment: EMPLOYEE --- (1:N) --- COMPUTER
	- Many-to-Many \[N:M\]
		-  e.g. Computer_Assignment: EMPLOYEE --- (N:M) --- COMPUTER
## Minimum Cardinality
- 0 if its Optional to pair
	- EMPLOYEE --- (N:M) --O- COMPUTER 
		- COMPUTER is optional to pair to EMPLOYEE	
- 1 if its Mandatory to pair
	- EMPLOYEE --- (N:M) --|- COMPUTER
		- COMPUTER is mandatory to pair to EMPLOYEE
- "Crow's Foot" Notation
	- Instead of draw (N:M) thing in the middle, use
	- ![[Pasted image 20230403144030.png|150]]![[Pasted image 20230403144243.png|200]]
# ID-Dependent Entities
- A child entity that must need a parent to exist.
	- All ID-Dependent entities are considered weak.
	- But a Weak Entity can be ID-Independent (Non-ID-Dependent)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230408164955.png|200]]
- This means the Minimum Cardinality to the parent must be 1
- e.g. A ROOM entity will not make sense w/o a BUILDING entity
	- ID-Dependent comes from the ROOM's key is the RoomID & BuildingID.
## Non-ID-Dependent
- An entity that can be identified without a paired parent.
	- Notated by dashed assignment/relationship line
	- This means that the the child's ID is not used/paired with the parent's ID as a key to find the child instance. 
	- This means that the parent must store the child instance's ID.
- e.g., VIN for cars is globally unique, replacing the need to use the MODEL's identifiers for itself.
	- - ![[Pasted image 20230408160309.png|200]]
		- Still it is a weak entity.
## Debate
- This is just an alternative design. You can debate which one to use, which is more readable, because it's the same.
	- ![[Pasted image 20230403152724.png|160]] is equal to ![[Pasted image 20230403152703.png|200]]
# Subtype Entities
- A Subtype Entity is a special case of Supertype Entity
	- Supertype contains all common info of an Entity, and Subtype branches the info to "extends specific subclass" info.
	- aka "is-a" relationship, which is a 1-to-1 Relationship.
	- e.g. STUDENT to (UNDERGRADUATE or GRADUATE)
		- Easiest way is for UNDERGRADUATE & GRADUATE will also use the STUDENT's ID as a key (ID-Dependent).
## Exclusive or Inclusive Subtypes
- We can have another Subtype Entity of BASKBALL_PLAYER & SOCCER_PLAYER, and a STUDENT can be both. That would be Inclusive Subtypes
- ![[Pasted image 20230403152235.png|300]]
	- STUDENT is either UNDERGRADUATE or GRADUATE.
	- STUDENT can be in both CLUBs.
## When to use Subtype Entities?
- When you see Many-to-Many relationship, cut it up and replace it with 1-to-Many relationship using Subtype Entities.
# Mixed Patterns
## The Line-Item Pattern
- Mixed Patter
- ![[Pasted image 20230405142003.png|250]]
	- Many to Many CUSTOMER & SALESPERSON got split up by SALES_ORDER
	- Many to Many SALES_ORDER & ITEM got split up by ORDER_LINE_ITEM
	- Extras:
		- Phone can be split up to store Work, Home, Cell numbers, and also account for multiple people having the same shared phone number.
		- Total shouldn't be an attribute. Total = Subtotal + Tax, which should just be calculated on the fly.
# Recursive Relationship
- When an entity has a relationship to itself
## Train Box Car
- ![[Pasted image 20230405144936.png|100]]   ![[Pasted image 20230405145029.png|300]]
	- A train's boxcars is pulled by another boxcar, 1-to-1
	- Because the relationship is optional, you can put NULL for the leading boxcar. (Otherwise, you put its own ID)
## Employees
- ![[Pasted image 20230405145928.png|100]]         ![[Pasted image 20230405145941.png|150]]
	- Also, if an employees is managed by multiple manager employees (creating a Many-to-Many), you can it up with a intermediary entity that holds multiple employee IDs.
# Multiple Relationships
- A child can have a mom and a dad. 
	- So, a CHILD can have to relationships to a PARENT, one for each.
	- Or, a BUS_ROUTE has a relationship for start & ending to CITY.
- If Many-to-Many, just cut it up like normal.
# ER Diagram to Table/Relations
## Example 1
- ![[Pasted image 20230410134512.png|100]]
- Turns into 
	- CLASS(<u>ClassName</u>, NumberHours, Description)
## Example 2
- ![[Pasted image 20230410134655.png|100]]
- Turns into 
	- CLASS(<u>ClassName</u>, NumberHours, Description)
	- SECTION(<u>ClassName</u>, <u>SectionNumber</u>, ClassDays, Time, Professor)
- Extra: If SectionNumber is globally unique / ID-Independent
	- CLASS(<u>ClassName</u>, NumberHours, Description)
	- SECTION(<u>SectionNumber</u>, ClassName, ClassDays, Time, Professor)
		- ClassName is an attribute, but is not an identifier.
## Example 3
- ![[Pasted image 20230410140418.png|200]]
	- COURSE(<u>CourseID</u>, CourseName)
	- ENROLLED(<u>CourseID</u>, <u>StudentID</u>, <u>Year</u>, <u>Quarter</u>, Grade)
	- STUDENT(<u>StudentID</u>, StudentName)
## Example 4 (1-to-1)
- 3 Entities, STUDENT is 1-to-1 to GRADSTUDENT & UNDERGRADSTUDENT
	- STUDENT(<u>StudentID</u>, StudentName)
	- GRADSTUDENT(<u>StudentID</u>, GRE)
	- UNDERGRADSTUDENT(<u>StudentID</u>, GPA, HighSchool)
