# Student Ex AGAIN
## 1st Design
- STUDENT(Sid, Sname, Saddr)
- ENROLLMENT(Sid, Cid, Grade)
- COURSE(Cid, Cname, Cdesc)
## 2nd Design
- STUDENT(Sid, Cid, Sname, Saddr, Cname, Cdesc, Grade)
## Debate
- Which is better?
	- Each can store the N:M relationship between STUDENTs and COURSEs.
	- However, **2nd is worse** because Sid, Sname, and Saddr is duplicated for each Cid.
# Functional Dependency
- When value of some attribute(s) determines the value of other attribute(s).
- e.g.
	- ![[Pasted image 20230417134702.png|200]]  ![[Pasted image 20230417134712.png|300]]
- The attribute on the left is called the Determinant
## Functional Dependencies Are Not Equations
- ![[Pasted image 20230417134809.png|250]] ![[Pasted image 20230417134820.png|200]]
	- See here, ObjectColor can't be plugged into an equation to find Weight and Shape.
## It's like a Map
- Like how f(x) = y, the Dependencies (x) is mapped to the its Determinant (y).
	- No formulas though, it's just a table/map
## Composite Determinants
- e.g. ![[Pasted image 20230417135210.png|200]]
## Rules

# Normal Forms
- A set of rules/conditions for a relations structure (schema)
	- A relation that follows rules is normalized
	- Like a “standard” for relations
	- Normal forms are created to address anomalies
	- We ask: "Is the table in the ___ Normal Form?"
- Normalization
	- Process of changing relation / database structure to conform to rules
## Normalization Theory
- Anomalies arise from 3+ sources
- Table of what Normal Forms to use from different Source of Anomaly
	- ![[Pasted image 20230417135812.png|450]]
	- (We are learning up to 4NF as those other forms introduces redundancy to achieve better performance)
## Anomaly Removal for Functional Dependencies
### First Normal Form
- **1NF**
	- A table that qualifies as a relation (max of 1 value per cell) is in 1NF
- Kick them out, make another table if not conforming.
- Can still have lingering anomalies.
### 2nd Normal Form
- **2NF**
	- Each non-key column depends on the key, aka no partial dependencies allowed.
	- Non-composite keys doesn't need 2NF check
- Can still have lingering anomalies.
#### Example
- R(<u>A</u>, <u>B</u>, N, O, P)
	- Not in 2NF if B -> N (it must be (A, B) -> N)
#### Converting to 2NF
	![[Pasted image 20230417145155.png|260]]
### 3rd Normal Form
- **3NF**
	- No dependencies allowed between non-key columns
- Kick them out, make another table if not conforming like 2NF.
- Can still have lingering anomalies.
### Boyce-Codd Normal Form
- **BCNF**
	- No key column is dependent on a non-key column
- Swap those columns, and kick the that dependent column out to another table.
	- Not always possible to decompose 3NF to BCNF
### Summary of Functional Dependencies: Put All Relations into BCNF
- ![[Pasted image 20230417150754.png|300]]
#### Example
- R(A,B,C,D,E)
1. Relations:
	- AB -> C
	- B -> C
	- D -> E
2. Candidate keys
	-  R(<u>A</u>,<u>B</u>,C,D,E)
3. Inside Normal Forms?
	- TODO
4. Repeat
	- IDK TODO
## Anomaly Removal for Multivalued Dependencies
### Problem Example
- STUDENT(<u>SID, Phone, Email</u>)
	- Though it is in 1,2,3,BC Normal Forms, there is still redundancy from the same student having multiple Phones and Emails.
### Multi-Value Dependency (MVD)
- A value that determines multiple values
	- e.g.
		- SID -> Phone
		- SID -> Email
		- Given a SID, it can give list of Phones and Emails
- e.g.
	- ![[Pasted image 20230419140033.png|200]] (see, lots of duplicates)
- The solution is pretty simple: Split those MVD to different tables
	- e.g. SID ->> Phone & SID ->> Email
		- STUDENT(<u>SID</u>, etc...)
		- STUDENTPHONE(<u>SID</u>, Phone)
		- STUDENTEMAIL(<u>SID</u>, Email)
### Fourth Normal Form
- **4NF**
	- Always put MVD in their own relation
- So, when you have MVD, split all of them up with a new table, making it like a Key-Value Pair type beat
