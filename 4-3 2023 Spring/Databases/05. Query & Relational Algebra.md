# Query?
- Was made for "users", not just comp sci nerds geeks.
- When you query, you can use the result to chain into other operations or queries
## Operations w/ 1 Table?
- Make table narrower/wider
- Make table shorter/longer
- Change order sort/randomize
## Operations w/ 2 Table?
- Union Tables appending new rows (must be same schema) 
	- row count = row1count + row2count
	- row count = row1count + row2count - duplicateRows
		- hash table used to track duplicates at cost of memory
- Union Tables appending new columns 
	- keys match add, more attributes (new row count = row1count \* row2count (aka cross product))
	- drop rows with missing keys
- Crush
	- e.g. "give avg grade with"
- Intersection of rows
- Subtraction of rows
# Core Relational Algebra
- Selection $\sigma$
- Project
- Union
- Set Difference
- Cartesian Product
- Rename
- (These are the most common query commands)
## Selection
- R1:=$\sigma_c$R2
	- R1 = Make table R2 shorter, keeping only what satisfy $c$
- ![[Pasted image 20230501135645.png|200]]
## Projection
- R1:=$\pi_L$R2
	- R1 = Make table R2 narrower, keeping only the columns in the list $L$
	- This will eliminate duplicate rows, so the table can also get shorter
		- (This is the opposite default of SQL. SQL must be specified to remove duplicates)
- ![[Pasted image 20230501135621.png|300]]
### Extended Projection
- $L$ can have algebra (e.g. "C=A+B,A.B", which makes new column C from values of A & B while keeping A & B too)
- ![[Pasted image 20230501135522.png|200]]
## Product
- R3 := R1$×$R2
	- ![[Pasted image 20230501135325.png|250]]  
- ![[Pasted image 20230501135419.png|300]]
## Theta Join
- R3:=R1$⋈_c$R2
	- Take the product R1 Χ R2, Then apply σ$_c$ (a bool condition) to the result.
	- R1 = add a column to R2, where the value of that column satisfy $c$ in R3.
- ![[Pasted image 20230501135433.png|300]]
## Natural Join
- R3:=R1$⋈$R2
	- Theta Join without a condition, meaning the condition is an equality predicate on columns of the same name. Then, concatenate the new column on the correct instanced key.
## Rename
- R1 := ρ$_c$(R2)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230501140827.png|250]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230501140908.png|300]]
	- Make new table R, with columns shop and addr from the table shops.

## Example: Tree for a Query
- Objective
	- ![[Pasted image 20230501141302.png|260]] ![[Pasted image 20230501141446.png|300]]
- Query as Tree
	- ![[Pasted image 20230501141349.png|250]]
		- We get the get the shops at Maple St. on the left branch from shops.
			- Also, we project to keep only "name".
		- We get the the all the shops that sells burger <\$3.
			- Also, we project to keep only "name".
		- At the top, we union both branches/tables, which will isolate shops at Maple St that sell <\$3 burgers.
			- the union was with the 1 and only "name" column.
- Query as Sequence Notation
	- ![[Pasted image 20230501142439.png|200]]
- Query in Linear Notation
	- ![[Pasted image 20230501142618.png|250]] (one line btw)
## Example: Self-Join
- Objective
	- ![[Pasted image 20230501143729.png|240]] ![[Pasted image 20230501141446.png|300]]
		- We need self-join because we are comparing it to itself
- Query as Tree
	- ![[Pasted image 20230501144431.png|250]]
- Query as Sequence Notation
	- ![[Pasted image 20230501144620.png|150]]
		- Makes a duplicate, but renamed to item1
		- Join them, the item1 column is added on
		- Select only entries where item != item1
		- Project, keeping only the shops column
- Query as Linear Notation
	- ![[Pasted image 20230501144517.png|300]]
# Bags
- ![[Pasted image 20230501145016.png|200]]
	- Set because it has no duplicates
- In SQL, the default behavior is to allow duplicates, and work with them.
	- You have to specify uniqueness if you don't want duplicate
## Bag Selection
- ![[Pasted image 20230501145104.png|200]]
	- A+B<5 is the condition, and that returns duplicates as both 1+2=3<5
## Bag Projection
- ![[Pasted image 20230501145215.png|150]]
## Bag Product
- ![[Pasted image 20230501150407.png|250]]
## Bag Theta-Join
- ![[Pasted image 20230501150433.png|250]]
## Bag Union

## Bag Intersection

# The Extended Algebra
- Extended for the database chums with their bags.
	- ![[Pasted image 20230501145518.png|250]]
## Duplicate Elimination
- R1 := δ(R2)
	- R1 consists of one copy of each tuple that appears in R2 one or more times.
- ![[Pasted image 20230501145718.png|150]]
	- Woah, it's gone
## Duplicate Sorting
- R1 := $τ_L$ (R2)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230501145953.png|250]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230501150027.png|150]]
	- It actually broke ties randomly \[(1,2),(5,2),(3,4)\] works too
	- $τ_{B,A}$ would break ties of B with A
## Aggregation Operators
- ![[Pasted image 20230501150633.png|250]]
	- (Aggregate is crushing the table to a single value)
	- MEDIAN is not provided in SQL as O(nlogn) takes longer than the O(n) for the supported aggregates
		- You can do it by sorting it yourself, and then find the middle row, and save as a custom aggregate.
- ![[Pasted image 20230501150655.png|100]]
	- So, aggregates take in account duplicates
## Grouping Operators
- R1 := γ$_L$ (R2)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230501151230.png|250]]
	- Applying γ$_L$
		- ![[Pasted image 20230501151301.png|100]]
### Example 1
- ![[Pasted image 20230501151515.png|300]]
	- Group by A, and aggregate those groups to column X with AVG(C)
### Example 2
- ![[Pasted image 20230501151701.png|300]]
	- Group by A while breaking ties by B, and aggregate those groups to column X with AVG(C)
		- The 1s in A were tied, so it used B to break it and group.
# Theta-Join: Dangling Tuples Problem
- ![[Pasted image 20230501152521.png|250]]
	- Join should return all tuples, but that's not the case here. RIP
	- ![[Pasted image 20230501152224.png|200]]
## Outerjoin
- We can save those dangling tuples, by completing the tuples with nulls
	-  ![[Pasted image 20230501152659.png|200]]
### Full Outerjoin

### Natural Outerjoin
- ![[Pasted image 20230508135010.png|300]]
### Left Outerjoin
- ![[Pasted image 20230508135029.png|150]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230508135040.png|300]]
#### Natural Left Outerjoin
- ![[Pasted image 20230508135107.png|300]]
### Right Outerjoin
- ![[Pasted image 20230508135135.png|150]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230508135157.png|300]]
#### Natural Right Outerjoin
- ![[Pasted image 20230508135214.png|300]]
# NULL Values
- ![[Pasted image 20230508135233.png|300]]
	- We determine NULL's value for the context used.
## Comparing NULLs and Values
- ![[Pasted image 20230508135430.png|230]]
	- NULL defaults to NULL
### Example
- ![[Pasted image 20230508140103.png|250]]
	- Because price = NULL, the query returns an empty table.
