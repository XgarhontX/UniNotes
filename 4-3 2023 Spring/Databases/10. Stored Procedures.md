## Example with MoviesDB
- ![[Pasted image 20230524151129.png|300]]

# Functions
- A function that is saved in the database to be called again, returning a value. (Scalar Function)
## Example
- ![[Pasted image 20230524151446.png|200]]
	- DETERMINISTIC tells query optimizer that an input given will have the same output, making the query optimizer save inputs and outputs to save time from rerunning same inputs.
## Table Valued Function
