# Computer Network
- An **interconnection of multiple devices**, also known as hosts, that are **connected using multiple paths** for the purpose of **sending/receiving data** or media. Computer networks can **also include** **multiple devices/mediums which help in the communication** between two different devices; these are known as Network devices and include things such as routers, switches, hubs, and bridges.
# Protocol
- A protocol is the set of rules or algorithms which define the way how two entities can communicate across the network and there exists different protocol defined at each layer of the OSI model. Few of such protocols are TCP, IP, UDP, ARP, DHCP, FTP and so on.

# Web What?
- Are Web Server, Web App, and Web Service the same things?
## Web Server
- Web pages (html)
## Web Service
- Raw data/info (XML/JSON)
	- Weather web service api
	- An API Key is usually needed to gatekeep connections. Obtaining an API Key is monetized.
- Endpoints
	- Given a base url like www.ourservice.com
		- auth endpoint which can handle 2 requests 
			- www.outservice.com/auth
				- GET
				- POST
		- message endpoint 
			- www.outservice.com/message
				- GET
	- We can think of endpoints like a name, and the request as an method.
	- We can send a GET and the arguments can be passed through the link
		- www.outservice.com/auth?name=charles
		- "?name=charles" is called the http body
		- It can also passed through as XML and JSON
- 
## Web App
- The combo of Web Server and Service, which the user can connect to through browsers and use.
# Volley
- GET won't allow sending bodies
- handleError will be auto called for 400 and 500 errors.
