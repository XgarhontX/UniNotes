# Problem
- Instance fields gets lost when the Activity or Fragment gets destroyed.
- For something small, such as switching Fragments, you'd not want to use Android mini SQL instance to store as persistent data.
## Solution
- Use a ViewModel that will persist through destruction to store data.
# Using a ViewModel
- The scope of a ViewModel is outside of the lifecycle of Activities and Fragments
- Created by just making a Java class extending ViewModel
## ViewModel Class
- Usually, the constructor doesn't have args.
- Create the ViewModel in the Activity if you want multiple Fragments to access it.
	- Use ViewModelProvider.
	- Otherwise, create in the Fragment.
- Fields that persist are type MutableLiveData\<T\>
	- Init & set those fields in the constructor
	- Provide getters and setters
- 2 line of thoughts
	- 1 ViewModel for each state/field
	- A ViewModel for multiple related states/fields
- MutableLiveData has built in observer to state support
	- MutableLiveData.observe(owner, observer) will pair observers to the data
	- On edit, MutableLiveData will signal observers to update.
	- On destruction of the a Fragment, MutableLiveData cleans up observers.
