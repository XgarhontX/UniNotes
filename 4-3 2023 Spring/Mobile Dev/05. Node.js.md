# Pushy
- Client A request to send a message to Client B, how does B receive it?
	- Bad: Client B spams web service to scan for response
	- N/A: Client A connects to Client B peer-to-peer, which will only be good with small client size.
	- Best: We use a another webservice (3rd party like Pushy).
		- Client A request Web Service.
		- Web Service requests Pushy.
		- Pushy sends to Client B, which clients has a listener.
