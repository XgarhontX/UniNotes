- Make a standard/canonical way your program will accept inputs

# Name Based Decisions
- Whitelist is the default
## Filenames
- Aids, untrusted
- C:/dir/test.dat, test.dat, ./test.dat are all the same file
	- Choose a canonical way to accept these
- Symbolic links can trick your program to open another file out of your whitelist
# Fonts
- A poorly chosen font can lead users to be phished
