- <u>Moor writes to explain the importance of Computer Ethics</u>
	- Lack of policies on determining how we should use computers ethically.
	- Also, lack of concepts to analyze computers ethically.
		- Ex: Make policy to protect software
			- What is a computer program?
			- Is it an IP or an algorithm that's not owned?
				- Patentable?
			- Binary vs Human readable code?
	- The value of computers has changed greatly over a short time.
## Computer Revolution
- What's so revolutionary about computers? What would separates Computer Revolution from Industrial Revolution?
	- Abundance, Newness & growth rate in processing and user friendliness? 
		- These condition aid the Computer Revolution, but not the essence.
	- What's revolutionary is how computers are **logically malleable**.
		- They can be shaped to take different inputs to output whatever via logical operations, and logic is everywhere.
			- With seemingly endless possibility, How can we mold the logic of computers to better serve our purposes?
			- Computers can be seen as calculators, but they aren't really mathematical. Binary is just a state of on and off, but we tend to explain it with 0 & 1.
## Anatomy of the Computer Revolution
- Probably will be like the 2 stages of Industrial Revolution
	- Last 40 years, computers are introduced. (i.e. How can we use computers to efficiently count votes?)
	- We are entering the 2nd stage now ==(Probably way in already)==, where computer permeate into essential activities (i.e. What is a fair election? (and the election process is already computerized))
	- From "How well do computers help us?" to "What is the nature of this work?" as automation spreads.
		- From a worker doing it, to a worker giving input/programming a computer to do the work.
	- From computers counting money, to "What is money?" (i.e. cryptocurrency)
	- Education too. ==(Zoom online)==
	- ==(Dating, Shopping, etc.)==
	- In short, why Computer Ethics should be considered:

## The Invisible Factors
- Invisible Abuse
	- Almost always, we know the input and output, but the underlying internal processing is invisible.
		- Ex: Using underflow to steal interest from a bank
		- Ex: Phone number tampering
		- Ex: Surveillance
- Invisible Programming Values
	- A programmer will have to decide on specifics that the request for it left out due to abstraction.
		- Ex: Biased airplane reservation
			- Could have not been intentional. It could have been sorted alphabetically or something, but that somehow caused a bias.
	- Sometimes, a programmer won't even know
		- Ex: Bugs
- Invisible Complex Calculation
	- The calculation/processing that goes on in computer programs is hard to comprehend/takes a long time to understand and debug.
- We can use computer to reveal those invisible factors, but when, where, how long does it take to do so?
# Gert
- Trying to introduce Common Morality to make moral disagreement more manageable.
	- Some moral question has a unique answer, some will not.
## Common Morality
- Common Morality is probably most commonly and unconsciously used.
	1. make clear that there is agreement on the overwhelming majority of cases;
	2. make clear the sources of moral disagreement and explain why there may sometimes be no unique best solution
	3. make clear that new and perplexing problems can be described in a way that shows their similarity to more familiar moral matters.
- Morality Def Again: *Morality is an informal public system applying to all rational persons, governing behavior that affects others, and includes what are commonly known as the moral rules, ideals, and virtues and has the lessening of evil or harm as its goal.*
	- Beliefs of a Moral Agent
		- Rationally Required
			- Must hold believes
			- Ex: people are vulnerable, they can be harmed by other people; and people are fallible, they have limited knowledge.
		- Rationally Prohibited
			- Irrational to hold beliefs
		- Rationally Allowed
			- Neither			
			- beliefs such as scientific or religious beliefs cannot be necessary to be a moral agent,
	- Morality is an Informal System ==(Again)==
		- Like a game
		- Disagreement is resolved or ignored without serious problems
			- Sometimes, the disagreement get transferred to political of legal system
				- Abortion is unresolvable moral question. Debate today concerns the scope of morality. Is baby/fetus/whatever a moral agent? Else, morality doesn't apply.
			- Most disagreements are on the facts.
				- Ex: How many deaths would be reduced from decreasing the speed limit by 10 mph?
				- Ex: How 
## The Moral Rules
- The Justified Moral Rules
	1. Do not kill. 
	2. Do not cause pain. 
	3. Do not disable. 
	4. Do not deprive of freedom. 
	5. Do not deprive of pleasure. 
	6. Do not deceive. 
	7. Keep your promises. 
	8. Do not cheat. 
	9. Obey the law. 
	10. Do your duty. (i.e. job in society)
	- Not absolute from justified exceptions
- The Moral Attitude
	- *Everyone is always to obey a moral rule except when a fully informed rational person can publicly allow violating it. If all fully informed rational persons publicly allow the violation, it is strongly justified, If fully informed rational persons disagree about whether to publicly allow the violation, it is weakly justified.*
- Violating a rule
	 1. What moral rules would be violated? 
	 2. What harms would be (a) avoided (not caused), (b) prevented, and (c) caused? (This means foreseeable harms and includes probabilities as well as kind and extent.) 
	 3. What are the relevant beliefs and desires of the people toward whom the rule is being violated? 
	 4. Does one have a relationship with the person(s) toward whom the rule is being violated such that one sometimes has a duty to violate moral rules with regard to the person(s) without their consent? 
	 5. What benefits would be caused? (This means foreseeable benefits and also includes probabilities, as well as kind and extent). 
	 6. Is an unjustified or weakly justified violation of a moral rule being prevented? 
	 7. Is an unjustified or weakly justified violation of a moral rule being punished? 
	 8. Are there any alternative actions that would be preferable? 
	 9. Is the violation being done intentionally or only knowingly? 
	 10. Is it an emergency situation that no person is likely to plan to be in?
## Consideration of a particular case
- Pirating / Copying software for a friend
	- In order to justify illegally copying software, one has to hold either that the law is clearly an unjust one, or that it is morally justifiable to break morally acceptable laws with which one disagrees for the benefit of oneself or one’s friends.
	- One can only justifiably violate a morally acceptable law in circumstances where one would be willing to publicly allow any morally acceptable law to be violated.
	- To publicly allow violations in such circumstances, that is, to favor everyone knowing that they are allowed to violate the law in such circumstances, would lead to anarchy and no impartial rational person would publicly allow it.
	- Doing something for a friend may be a good motive, but motives do not determine the morality of an action.
## Alternative moral theories
- The Kantian system requires all of one’s actions to be tested for impartiality by the categorical imperative, and consequentialist systems require one to regard the interests of everyone impartially. Common morality does not require impartiality with respect to all of one’s actions, nor that one regard the interests of everyone impartially; it requires impartiality only when considering the violation of a moral rule.
- The public nature of morality and the limited knowledge of rational persons help to explain why impartial obedience to the moral rules is required to achieve the point of morality, which is lessening the suffering of harm.
- Morality also differs from the systems of both Kant and Mill in that it does not require all moral questions to have unique answers, but explicitly allows for a limited area of disagreement among equally informed impartial rational persons.
