Moor calls for more consideration on the importance of computer ethics. There's a vacuum of policies and concepts on analyzing computers ethically, as computers has changed greatly over a short time. Computers are logically malleable, able to take an endless variety of inputs and logically programmed to give a desired output. Computers permeates pretty much every activity now. Gaps between level of abstractions of a computer program allows for abuse and biases towards the users. The vacuum needs to fill to keep up with the ever-growing power of computers.
I agree with Moor. Before computers, machine are built for a single purpose, unable to be programmed to do other things. Also, computers has permeated socially. For example, someone on their phone and especially with headphones most likely don't want any social interactions at the moment. 

Gert explains common morality. Probably the most commonly and unconsciously used, common morality is using common sense to apply the evaluation of moral beliefs from known moral cases to the unfamiliar. Basically, like Tavani, a moral system consists of informal rules that are publicly known and implicitly kept. Using pirating for a friend as an example, Gert emphasizes how someone violating a morally justified law means they would need to be ok with other morally justified laws to be publicly broken too.
My understanding of this theory is not as good as the others previously discussed, being more lax. I think the essence of common morality is being consistent. Consistently adhere to a morally just law, or else breaking that implies you are willing others morally just laws can be broken too, leading to anarchy. The example given keeps focusing on justifying why someone should follow the piracy law, and I didn't get if it answered is the act of piracy is bad. Maybe there's a different example can help me understand?

Similar to how Tavani described it, a moral system consists of informal rules that are publicly known and implicitly kept. One of the most important rationally required moral belief is that humans are vulnerable, fallible, and have limited knowledge. Most moral cases has an agreement, and it's ok for a moral disagreement to not have a single best solution.
