Moral Foundations Theory consists of Care, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority, Sanctity, & Liberty, the moral foundations/themes that are reoccurring in cultures and which we are naturally wired from birth to learn better growing up. Through surveys in various regions of the world, Haidt and his peers found that Liberals value Care & Fairness most, Conservatives value everything balanced, and Libertarians value Liberty most. My results from the IDRlabs test say that I have a balanced moral foundation, which is closest to a Conservative. With that result... I'm not clicking "SHARE ON TWITTER".Â 

And with that joke, I think that's why I found Haidt's interview so interesting. He points out how politics has devolved into antagonizing the other side. When the Civil Rights Act passed, he says, that was a turning point where moral division started being used for political gains. I was surprised to find the interview being uploaded in 2012 because nowadays, I feel like everyone in politics is relentlessly antagonizing each other, and it's why I absolutely hate it. I try to avoid it at all costs, especially as a topic when conversing with others. Avoiding politics means I avoid most current events too, making me extremely ignorant (why I'm abysmal in class discussions). With the increase in moral division usage, Haidt calls for the return to a moral agent's impartial view in politics and warns that making reasoning sacred creates info bubbles/confirmation bias. Content ushering algorithms e.g. YouTube & TikTok's or even search engines definitely won't be helping towards this.

Maybe I'm already in a filter bubble, and my joke about Twitter doesn't make sense. Is Twitter actually somehow not a cesspool?
