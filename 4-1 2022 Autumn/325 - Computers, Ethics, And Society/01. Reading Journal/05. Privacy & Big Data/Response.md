Through computerization, Moor writes that information has become greased, able to be efficiently stored and retrieved. He proposes the control/restricted access conception of privacy: we can't really control information about ourselves when it's already greased, so privacy is controlling when that information is accessible by others. Moor wants more attention into creating laws/policies around privacy, pointing out the example of how lack of privacy in genetic predictive testing can lead to harming future generations.
In the Database Nation reading, it seems that policies around privacy Moor calls for were undermined. With the national databank never getting built, we now have private databanks. Back then, it was bank databases, and its nonchalant privacy led to identity theft. Now that databases are ubiquitous, I think a random person on the internet can be the journalist role in a different Bork scenario, for better or worse. 
This growth also permeated into the internet and ads, which the NBC article briefly went over how clearing cookies is not enough to get rid of trackers. The latest tracking technique I remember hearing about was by checking if a tab icon needed to be downloaded. But even with blocked trackers, sites will still have your IP address. That's why you have to use NordVPN (code: yomama). Either pay with your privacy with trackers, or pay money for a VPN. I guess Tor is another way, but isn't it capped ~100kB/s?
