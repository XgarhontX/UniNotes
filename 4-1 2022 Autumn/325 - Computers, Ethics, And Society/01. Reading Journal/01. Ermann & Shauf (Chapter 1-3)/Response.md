The reading was on defining what an ethical choice/act is. A different ethical theory is discussed in each chapter by different writers.  
-The first chapter is on utilitarian ethics, in which ethical acts result in the greatest intrinsic good. With intrinsic good being happiness, a utilitarian chooses the action that results in the highest net happiness. Utilitarians will still pick that act even if the happiness isn't immediate, if it's to pick between the lesser of two evils, or if it requires self-sacrifice. Utilitarianism is also universalist ethics, which is neither egoistic nor altruistic ethics and where your happiness is equivalent to another person. Moral rules are treated as a rule of thumb, as doing something immoral can be the act with the highest net happiness. One drawback is that fully obtaining net happiness empirically requires a god.Â   
-The second chapter is on Kantian ethics, where people should always be treated as ends, never simply as means. Kantianism views humans as superior to animals, as rational being, having desires and goals which gives everything else value. So as rational beings, we should respect each other rational abilities. It also means responsibility, which also permits punishment. A critique is how absolute Kantianism is to moral rules.  
-The third chapter is on Nicomachean ethics. Aristotle writes that ethical action exercises the mind's faculty. He doubts how enjoyment, fame, virtue, and wealth are the ultimate good. He suggests that the ultimate good is being self-sufficient, "the quality which makes life to be desirable and lacking in nothing even when considered by itself; and this quality we assume to belong to happiness", requiring exercise & betterment of our skills to rationalize. A critique is how vague an ethical choice is, unlike the utilitarian idea of quantifiable net happiness.  
-Question: Which of these theories are most prevalent & useful in computer science discourse?
