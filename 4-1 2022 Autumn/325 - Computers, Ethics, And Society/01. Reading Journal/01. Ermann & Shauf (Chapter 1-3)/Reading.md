**What constitutes an ethical choice? Does an ethical choice maximize happiness? Goodness? Does it follow some other universal principle? Is a universally applicable principle even possible?**

# The Best Action is the One with the Best Consequences (Utilitarian)

- **Utilitarian Ethics / Utilitarianism**: whatever is intrinsically good should be promoted, and, accordingly, our obligation (or duty) is always to act so as to promote the greatest possible intrinsic good.
## Utilitarianism
1. Utilitarian focus on **Voluntary Acts** when talking about right and wrong acts.
	- An act is voluntary if the person could have acted differently if he had so chosen.
2. No preference for the immediate.
	- Happiness is as intrinsically good tomorrow, so it's better to do the act that brings more happiness even though it takes longer, unless you think it has a lower chance of happening.
3. Consider unhappiness.
	- Do the act where the net happiness is highest.
4. Choose the lesser of the 2 evils.
	- If two acts produce the same happiness but with different unhappiness, do the one that produce less unhappiness because "it leads to a smaller balance of unhappiness over happiness".
5. Don't assume an act is right solely from Utilitarianism.
	- Ex: A group torturing an individual to death. The group gains more happiness from the unhappiness of the tortured.
6. Self-Sacrifice
	- The net happiness considers you and others as well, so do the act that produces the most happiness, even if you're happier otherwise.
	- ### Egoistic VS Altruistic Ethics
		- **Egoistic Ethics** is doing acts that promote your own interest above all others.
		- **Altruistic Ethics** is doing acts that promote others completely before your own interest.
		- Utilitarianism is neither. It is a **Universalist Ethics**, where your happiness is equal to another person.
		- A lot of times, acts that are egoistic are also utilitarian. Acts that increase your happiness solely without expense of others.
	- It is only when your interests cannot be achieved except at the cost of sacrificing the greater interests of others that utilitarianism recommends self-sacrifice.
7. "Don't kill," "Don't tell lies," "Don't steal"?
	- These **Moral Rules** are on the whole good, not because they are intrinsically bad, but because the unhappiness those acts produce. 
	- However, there are exceptions like killing Hitler or killing a trigger-happy public shooter would stop more death. Arguing to be a pacifist through Utilitarianism would mean showing how all killings would produce net unhappiness.
	- "*The action which promotes the maximum happiness is right. <br>This action is the one which promotes the maximum happiness. <br>Therefore, This action is right.*"
		- The 2nd premise causes debate using empirical evidence to weigh happiness. This debate can't be fully settle without a god.
	- For the Utilitarian, these moral rules are rules of thumb. One will violate them if it's justified for net happiness.

# The Best Action Is the One in Accord with Universal Rules (Kantian)

- A moral theory by Immanuel Kant.
- **Kantian Ethics / Kantianism**: People should always be treated as ends, never as simply a means. (It is wrong to ignore another person's legitimate desires and to use him or her just to get what you want.)
- (Kant saw Humans > Animals, where animal are a means for an end for humans and are not rational beings.)
## Kantianism
1. Kant's ultimate principle: **The Categorical Imperative**
	- "Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."
	- "Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only."
2. The value of human beings "is above all price".
	- People have desires and goals, which gives things has a value.
		- Ex: Your goal to travel gives a car its value.
	- Humans have an intrinsic worth, i.e. dignity. Humans are the embodiment of moral law because we are rational beings.
		- This means you should treat other humans different from a thing that has value (aka a means to an end)
	- Ex: You need a loan from your friend that you can't pay back. Instead of manipulating your friend and lying (using your friend as a means), you tell the truth and let you friend make up their mind (rationally respecting them).
3. Human Dignity
	- Because we treat humans as rational beings, we hold others responsible for their actions.
		- Punishment is allowed because of responsibility.
		- This is unlike animals and mentally sick people.
4. Treat others "in kind"
	- The acts of another responsible agent helps determine how to respond to them.
		- "His own evil deed draws the punishment upon himself."

# The Best Action Is the One That Exercises the Mind's Faculties (Nicomachean)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHVuzec6s0c&ab_channel=BilboroughRS
- A moral theory by Aristotle (4th c. BCE)
- **Nicomachean Ethics**: Ethical action consists in the active exercise of the mind's faculties. Those who are most involved with computerization, for whom reasoning and intellectual challenge are highly valued, may well agree with Aristotle.
## Nicomachean Ethics
- <u>What is the best/ultimate/final good obtainable by action?</u>
- Reasons for doubting enjoyment, fame, virtue, or wealth is the whole good.
	- Mere enjoyment like of the partying high status people are overshadowed by those seeking honor in their career.
	- Honor is more like seeking self-worth and being one can be virtuous when sleeping. Someone can be each and still be unhappy though.
	- Wealth is just a means to get something else.
- Reaffirmation that the good is the ultimate and self-sufficient object of desire, and that "happiness" is the good.
	- Like how each profession has some practical good they strive for. Medicine is health, military is victory, architecture is a building, etc.
	- "Let us define self-sufficiency as the quality which makes life to be desirable and lacking in nothing even when considered by itself; and this quality we assume to belong to happiness."
 - What is distinctive of man is reason, so the happiness which is the good must be the exercise of reason in living.
	 - Us humans have faculties just like other animals. Hands, feet, eyes, etc.
	 - What sets us apart is using our faculties to rationalize, exercising our skills to conform to excellency.
