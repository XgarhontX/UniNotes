# Greedy Technique
- for solving optimization problems
- greedy algorithms make **locally optimal choices**
	- at each moment, make the choice that looks best
	- “hope” that this will lead to a **globally optimal solution**
		- actually, that is something you need to prove
- greedy algorithms do not always yield an optimal solution
	- when they do, great!
	- else, it can be an approximation
- Try creating a greedy algorithm first. Until you fail and can't, then revert to DP.
# Change-Making Problem
- Ex: Pay someone 67¢.
	- Repeatedly choose the largest coin $\leq$ remaining cents
	- 67¢ = (2 x 25¢) + (1 x 10¢) + (1 x 5¢) + (2 x 1¢)
## Pseudocode
- ![[Pasted image 20221129145447.png|300]]
	- $\Theta(m)$
### Correctness
- Greedy algorithm always finds “a” solution, provided that the smallest denomination is 1.
- Whether this is the optimal solution depends on coin set!
- Greedy works in the US: for the coin set {1¢,5¢,10¢,25¢}, the greedy method always finds the optimal solution.
	- It may not work for other coin sets. For D = {1¢, 10¢,25¢} and n = 30, the greedy method produces a solution 1 25¢ + 5 x 1¢, which is not as good as 3 x 10¢.
- There is a dynamic programming approach that always yields an optimal solution (less efficient!! $\Theta(mn)$)
#### Greedy vs DP
- ![[Pasted image 20221129150122.png|250]]
	- Greedy is way faster
	- DP covers all coin denominations
# Fractional Knapsack Problem
- fractional knapsack problem: setup is the same but now the thief can take fractions of items, rather than having to make a binary choice for each item.
## Greedy
- order the items per value per pound (i.e. ratio $v_i$/$w_i$)
- pick up as much as you can from the item with highest $v_i$/$w_i$
- if any space is left, take as much as possible from the item with the second highest $v_i$/$w_i$
- repeat until the knapsack is full
### Ex
- ![[Pasted image 20221129150748.png|200]]
	- Max Value = 220
### Correctness
- greedy method in which you pick up items in decreasing order of value/weight yields an optimal solution for the fractional knapsack problem.
- 0-1 knapsack problem can be applied, but it's not guaranteed optimal.
	- Extra: With an unlimited supply of every item, the greedy algorithm's answer is $\geq$ 1/2 the value of the optimal solution. This is an estimation.
# Dijkstra’s Shortest Path
- Given a weighted graph G and a source vertex s, find the shortest weighted path from s to every other vertex in G.
- Applications:
	- Fastest package delivery route
	- Cheapest route
	- Shortest path between you & people in your social network

## Greedy
- Build a tree with root $s$
- Each step, add the node which is closest to the root yet still outside the tree
- $V_T$ is the set of vertices already in the tree.

## Pseudocode
- ![[Pasted image 20221129152813.png|300]]
## Analysis
- Use priority queue to keep track of smallest cost
	- We do DeleteMin() $|V|$ times (every vertices need to dequeue into the tree)
- We do Decrease() $|E|$ times (every edge gets investigated once)
- Total $\Theta(|E|\log|V|)$
### True or False
- "T is a spanning tree of G (the graph)"
	- True
- "T is a minimum spanning tree of G"
	- False, because we could specify the wrong source
# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
- ![[Pasted image 20221203143115.png|300]]
	- Tree that includes all Vertices and the minimum amount & cost of Edges to connect all Vertices.
	- MST has $|E|=|V|-1$
## Prim's
- Start by picking one V as the source.
- Repeatedly add in any available adjacent Vs, ones where the edges are cheapest.
## Kruskal's
- Start by presorting all Es by it's weight/cost in ascending order.
- Iterate through the sorted list (from least to greatest), and add in the E if it doesn't make a cycle.
	- ~~To check for a cycle, we can use a checklist/table/hashmap that indicates which V is already visited, skipping adding the E if it connects to an already visited V.~~
## Cut Property
- ![[Pasted image 20221203144518.png|350]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20221203145059.png|250]]
		- Wow, we "Cut" it into to sets.
### Proof of Cut Property
- We will show that 
	- T does not contain e, implying that T is not a MST of G
- Ok then, T is a spanning tree (ST) of G, meaning T contains a path P from v to w.
	- ![[Pasted image 20221203150026.png|250]]
		- Following P from v, we will have to encounter a different vertex in V-S (let that be w') and another node after in S that connects to w' (let that be v'), and let the edge connecting w' & v" be e'
	- Now let $T'=T-\{e'\} \cup \{e\}$ (if we replace e' with e, swapping the cost) then T is a ST and T' is cheaper than T.
		- Therefore T could haven't been a MST, proving the Cut Property
### Prim's Correctness & Cut Property
- At each step, Prim's algorithm adds the lightest edge $e=(v,w)$ with v already in the partial tree, and w not yet.
- Let S be that partial tree.
	- $v \in V_T$
	- $w \in V-V_T$
- Then $e=(v,w)$ is the cheapest edge crossing $V$ into $V-V_T$
- So this prove s that e is safe to add & Prim's is correct.
### Kruskal's Correctness & Cut Property
-  At each step, Kruskal's algorithm adds the lightest edge $e=(v,w)$ that does not create a cycle.
- Let S be the set of nodes to which v already has a path before adding e.
	- Then $w\in V-S$ because, otherwise, we would be creating a cycle.
	- furthermore, $e=(v,w)$ is the cheapest edge crossing out from V=V-S (because of presorting edges)
- So this proves that e is safe to add & Kruskal's is correct

### Efficiency
- Pseudocode (not textbook)
	- ![[Pasted image 20221203152001.png|350]]
		- Uses Priority Queue
		- $u=(p_u,d_u)$
			- $d_{u}$ is cost to attach the previous vertex/node ($p_u$)
	- Ex running:

		- ![[Pasted image 20221203152603.png|250]] then c(b,3)
	- Function calls
		- 1 makequeue(V) $\in O(|V|)$ (using minheap)
		- |V| deletemin(H) $\in O(|V|\log|V|)$
		- |E| decreasekey(H,z) $\in O(|E|\log|V|)$
		- TOTAL $\in O(|V| + |V|\log|V| + |E|\log|V|)=O(|E|\log|V|)$ (adjacency list)
			- $O(|V|^2)$ if (adjacency matrix & unordered array as queue)

		- $\pi$ is the root / representative node of the set
	- Cycle checking and whatnot can be costly
		- We can use a Disjoint Set ADT
			- makeset(x)
				- we **make set for each node/vertex**
			- find(x) 
				- after dequeuing an edge, we **find() both vertices that is connected by that edge**.
			- union(x,y) 
				- If both vertices from the dequeued each are in **different sets**, we can union() both
				- **else,** it means that both vertices are in the same set, **creating a cycle if we add the edge.** (so don't add it)
			- ![[Pasted image 20221203154623.png|75]]
	- Function calls
		- |V| makeset() $\in O(|V|)$
		- 2|E| find() $\in O(|E|\log|V|)$
		- |V|-1 union() $\in O(|V|)$

				- union(b,c) -->
					- ![[Pasted image 20221203162224.png|100]]
				- union(c,e) does nothing. c & e both has a root of b, they are in the same set.
				- union(a,b) -->
					- ![[Pasted image 20221203162511.png|100]] (alternative is b being the root since both had a rank of 1)

		- TOTAL $\in O(|V| + |E|\log|V| + |V|)$
			- completed graph: $|E| \geq |V|-1$
			- any graph: $|E| \leq |V|^2$
			- so $|E|\log|E| \leq |E|\log|V|^2$
			- $O(|V| + |E|\log|V| + |V|)$$= |E|\log|V|$
