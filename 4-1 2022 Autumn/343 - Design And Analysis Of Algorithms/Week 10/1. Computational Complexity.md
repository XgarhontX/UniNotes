# Tractable Problem
- Tractable Problem: a problem that can be solved in polynomial time
- Intractable Problem: a problem that can not be solved in polynomial time
	- (Polynomial time: if it is $\in O(n^{k})$, k is a constant)
- An algorithm $\in \Theta(2^n)$ doesn't imply the problem is intractable.
# Hamiltonian Cycle Problem
- “Does a given graph have a Hamiltonian cycle, i.e. a path that starts and ends at the same vertex and visits all other **vertices** exactly once?”
	- ![[Pasted image 20221206140833.png|400]]
- We don't know if it is Tractable or not
	- We can verify a Hamiltonian cycle in polynomial time.
# Euler Tour Problem
- “Does a given graph have an Euler tour, i.e. a path that starts and ends at the same vertex and visits each **edge** exactly once?”
	- ![[Pasted image 20221206141409.png|300]]
	- The graph will have a Euler tour if
		- the graph is connected (BFS & DFS)
		- each node has an even degree (even bridges, a way in and out)
			- So the 7 Bridges of Konigsberg does not have a Euler tour.
- This is a Tractable problem
# Graph Coloring Problem
- As an optimization problem: “What is the smallest number of colors needed to color the nodes of a given graph, such that **adjacent nodes have different colors**?”
	- ![[Pasted image 20221206141942.png|200]] ![[Pasted image 20221206142002.png|200]]
- As a decision problem: “Can we color a given graph with ≤ m colors?”
	- If m = 2, then we can do it in polynomial time
		- We are checking if it is bipartite (one set of nodes connects to the other half set of nodes).
		- We can use BFS to check.
# Decision problems
- computer science theoreticians focus on decision problems
	- yes/no answers
- optimization problems can be cast to decision problems\
	- e.g. “smallest number m of colors to color a given graph?”
		- becomes “can we color the graph with · m colors? m=1,2,3,...”
- If evidence that a decision problem is hard, then evidence that the related optimization problem is hard too
# P and NP
- A (decision) problem X is said to be
	- $\in$ P (**polynomial**) iff X is solvable in polynomial time
	- $\in$ NP (**nondeterministic polynomia**l) iff X is verifiable in polynomial time
		- Shortest Path $\in P, NP$
		- MST $\in P, NP$
		- Optimal BST $\in P, NP$
		- Sorting $\in O(n!)$ $\in P, NP$
		- Interval Scheduling $\in P, NP$ 
		- Knapsack $\in NP$ 
		- Traveling Salesman $\in NP$ 
		- Subset Sum $\in NP$ 
- Examples of problems in NP:
	- determining whether a graph has a Hamiltonian circuit
	- determining whether a graph has a cycle (is even in P)
- $P \subseteq NP$
	- the Clay Mathematics Institute will pay $1 million to the first person who can prove or disprove the claim that P = NP
	- Most scientists believe that P and NP are not the same
		- But so far nobody has been able to give a proof
	- ![[Pasted image 20221206143654.png|300]]
# NP-complete problems
- Let X be a decision problem, Y also.
	- X is in P if X is solvable in polynomial time
	- X is in NP if X is verifiable in polynomial time
	- X is in NP-complete if X is in NP & for each Y in NP: Y $\leq_P$ X
		- Meaning Y can be solved in polynomial time when you solved X. 
- Hardest problems in NP
- Cook-Levin theorem: proof of a first NP-complete problem
- if Z is in NP and there is an NP-complete problem X that polynomials reduces to Z, then Z is NP-complete too.
	- To show that Z is NP-complete, we show that
		- Z is in NP
		- there is an NP-complete problem U such that U $\leq_P$ Z
	- Meaning, there is a known set of NP-complete problems
		- ![[Pasted image 20221206150727.png|300]]
			- All problems are NP-complete and polynomially reduce to each other (Y $\leq_P$ X).
			- Lots of these problems needs to be solve algorithms efficiently
- Karp’s 21 NP-complete problems

	- ![[Pasted image 20221206151249.png|300]]
	- "Throwing a party, the graph's edges are bad relationships that will cause chaos at the party. How many people can you invite at the same time?"

- Hamiltonian Path
	- Like Hamiltonian Cycle, but you don't have to end at the start.
	- Hamiltonian Cycle reduces to Hamiltonian Path
		- meaning we can use Path's algorithm to aid in finding Cycle
- Longest Path
	- Reducing from Hamiltonian Path.
