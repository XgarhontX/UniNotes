# CPU Virtualization
- 1 CPU = Many Virtual CPUs
- Time Sharing
	- Run one process, pause it, run another
	- How do we swap between processes efficiently (we need to load into registers the PC ad stack pointer when we swap)?
# Process
- A process is a running program.
## Components
- A process contains all state for a program in execution
- Memory
	- ![[Pasted image 20230110154656.png|300]]
- Registers
	- Program Counter, Stack Pointer
## Processes
- Modern OS can run multiple processes simultaneously
	- We must save the registers of a process when we switch
	- Multiple Process can be concurrently running the same Program
### Process Timings
- Increase CPU Utilization by overlapping one process's computation with another's wait (e.g. I/O)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230110155554.png|200]]
- Reduce Latency by concurrency (gives user a sense that more is happening)

# OS's (Kernel's) View of Processes
## Implementing Process
- Keep a data structure for each process
	- **PCB**: Process Control Block
		- ![[Pasted image 20230110160528.png|100]]
		- Contains all info of a process
- Track **state** of process
	- Running, ready (runnable), waiting, etc. 
- Includes **information necessary to run**
	- Registers, virtual memory mappings, etc. 
	- Open files (including memory mapped files)
	- PCB is also maintained when the process is not running
		- needed to restore
- Various **other** data
	- Credentials (user/group ID), priority, etc. 
	- It is a heavyweight abstraction
### Process State
- A process has an execution state to indicate what it is doing
	- <u>Running</u>: Executing instructions on the CPU
		- It is the process that has control of the CPU (not even by OS)
		- How many processes can be in the running state simultaneously? (answer: CPU core count)
	- <u>Ready</u>: Waiting to be assigned to the CPU
		- Ready to execute, but another process is executing on the CPU 
	- <u>Waiting</u>: Waiting for an event, e.g., I/O completion
		- It cannot make progress until event is signaled (disk completes)
	- <u>etc</u>.
		- Zombies (killed but PCB exists still because parent needs to resolve)
- As a process executes, it moves from state to state
	- What state do you think a process is in most of the time? (answer: Ready, handful of cores with hundreds of processes)
#### Process State Graph
- ![[Pasted image 20230110162029.png|300]]
	- Can a process go from waiting directly to running? (answer: No, because switch core should pick it up? Also priority matters)
	- The OS can stop Running process back to Sharing to share time with other Processes
#### Examples of State Transition
- Switch because finish
	- ![[Pasted image 20230110162559.png|250]]
- Switch because I/O
	- ![[Pasted image 20230110162621.png|250]]
## PCBs and Hardware State
- The procedure of changing the CPU hardware state from one process to another is called **Context Switch**
	- When a process is **running**, its **hardware state** (PC, SP, regs, etc.) is **in the CPU**
		- The hardware registers contain the current values
	- When the OS **stops** running a process, it **saves** the current values of the registers **into** the process’s **PCB**
	- When the OS is ready to **start** executing a **new** process, it **loads** the hardware registers **from** the values stored in that process’ **PCB**
		- hundreds to thousands of times a sec
		- The best time to Context Switch is when the process becomes Blocked
- Ex Diagram

		- CPU isn't 100% utilized all the time because reloading PCB
# User’s (Programmer’s) View of Processes
## Creating Process
- A process is created by another process
	- Parent is creator, child is created (Unix: ps “PPID” field)
	- What creates the first process? (Unix: init (PID 0 or 1))
		- Usually the boot is PID 1
			- And the boot process creates child processes, which creates their child processes
		- When a parent process is killed, that child process's new parent is the grandparent
- Parent defines resources and privileges for its children
	- Unix: Process User ID is inherited – children of your shell execute with your privileges 
		- child will have equivalent or less privilege
- After creating a child  
	- the parent may either wait for it to finish its task or continue in parallel
		- e.g. cmd waits for child & boot allows child to run concurrent
## Process Creation: Unix
- In Unix, processes are created using fork()
	- in fork()
- fork()
	- Creates and initializes a new PCB
	- Creates a new address space
	- Initializes the address space with a copy of the entire contents of the address space of the parent
	- returns "twice"
		- Returns the child’s PID to the parent, “0” to the child (this doesn't mean its PID is 0).
		- It can return -1 to parent, saying that it failed.
	- fork() ex:
		- ![[Pasted image 20230112154731.png|300]]
			- 1 will print always.
			- 2 will usually not print, because the child will succeed
			- 3 & 4, we don't know which one comes first.
				- The OS will decide which process to continue. 
				- HOWEVER, in this case, 4 (parent) will probably come first because the program is so short.
			- If we wait() or add more tasks in 3, the print can come after the terminal prompts for user input because the terminal is based on when the parent finishes.
### Duplicating Address Space
- ![[Pasted image 20230110172728.png|300]]
	- The child gets a copy of the address space, starting it's PC at the same place.
	- Both are using same program
		- The program accounts for the child vs parent PID, changing execution, diverging
			- ![[Pasted image 20230110173419.png|300]]
		- we check PID == 0 because the return value for fork() returns the child’s PID to the parent, “0” to the child.
### fork() Example
- ![[Pasted image 20230112160809.png|200]]
	- The child will copy everything (PCB) from parent during fork(). 
		- Each then has their own independent address space.
		- The child will print 5, as a = 5 for the child.
		- The child will also be able to read the file.
## Wait()
- Often, it is convenient to pause until a child process has finished
	- Think of executing commands in a shell
- Unix wait(int \*wstatus)
	- \*wstatus is usually null
		- Else, this can be a way to communicate between parent and child
	- wait()'s return is the child's PID
	- Suspends the current process (turns it Blocked) until any child process ends
	- waitpid() suspends until the specified child process ends
- Not the same as sleep() (which is looping in running wasting cycles)
- Unix: Every process must be “reaped” by a parent
	- What happens if a parent process exits before a child? 
		- answer: grandparent becomes parent
		- PID still stays the same.
- What do you think a “zombie” process is?
	- answer: parent is waiting on the child, the child's PCB exists to resolve parent's wait().
	- alt & dangerous: The child is done, the parent is waiting. Parent gets killed before cleaning up zombies child.
		- Failsafe: Force kill zombie child.
### fork() with wait() Example
- ![[Pasted image 20230112162315.png|300]]
	- Parent now prints after the child.
		- wc stores the wait()'s return, the child's PID, which is what the parent was waiting on.
	- If we add in a wait() in the child's if condition
		- Nothing happens, the child doesn't have any other child to wait on.
## exec()
- Wait a second. How do we actually start a new program?
	- exec(2) & its family (primarily execve(3) & execvp(3))
		- Runs a program from the same process.
- Calling exec()
	- Stops the current process (not killed, PID is still the same)
		- Any code after exec() will not be reached.
		- Loads and Replace the new program into the current process’ address space.
		- Initializes hardware context and args for the new program
	- Note: It does not create a new process
	- What does it mean for exec to return?
		- -1 if not successful
		- Nothing else, as there is no longer that original program to use it.
	- The second arg of exec() & family takes in the whole cmd & args. It automatically ignores the 1st token.
### Exercise
- When you call a program in the shell (e.g. sleep(100))
	- Fork, Exec, Wait is the ordered system calls that happens, because we want the shell to still exist.
