# Page Faults
- What happens when a process accesses a page is evicted?
	1. When the OS evicts a page, it sets the PTE as invalid and stores the location of the page in the swap file in the PTE.
	2. When a process accesses the page, the invalid PTE will cause a trap (<u>page fault</u>)
	3. The trap will run the OS page fault handler 
	4. Handler uses the invalid PTE to locate page in swap file
	5. Reads page into a physical frame, updates PTE to point to it
		- Evict one to SWAP if needed
	6. Resumes process

- In Step 5, OS might need to evict pages. What is the most efficient page replacement algorithm (aka page eviction policy)?
## Working Set Model
- A good rule of thumb is the 80/20 rule
- Keep the 20% useful pages in RAM, the other 80% in memory
- ![[Pasted image 20230307171424.png|300]]
	- The red useful VAs are usually code. We want to keep that in RAM and not SWAP
# Page Replacement Algorithms
## First-In First-Out (FIFO)
- Simple, evict oldest fetched page in system
### Examples
- Reference string **1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5**, 1, 2, **3, 4,** 5 w/ 3 physical page frames available
	- Amount of page faults: 9 (bolds are faults)
- Reference string **1, 2, 3, 4,** 1, 2, **5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5** w/ 4 physical page frames available
	- Amount of page faults: 10 (bolds are faults)
		- wth, even worst
#### Belady’s Anomaly
- ![[Pasted image 20230307172814.png|200]]
- More physical memory doesn’t always mean fewer faults
## Optimal Page Replacement (Cheating)
- What is optimal (if you knew the future)? Replace page that will not be used for longest period of time.
	- Impossible to implement, this is the example of the most optimal solution.
	- aka Belady’s Algorithm
### Example
- Reference string 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 w/ 4 physical page frames available
	- Amount of page faults: 6 (bolds are faults)
		- 1
		- 12
		- 123
		- 1234
		- 1235
		- **4235**, 1435, 1245 (but you would want to do bold because FIFO as tie breaker)
## Least Recently Used (LRU)
- Use past data to predict the future
- Approximate Belady’s Algorithm by evicting the page that has not been used for the longest time the past (assumes that page will be needed again in the future)
### Example
- Reference string **1, 2, 3, 4**, 1, 2, **5**, 1, 2, **3, 4, 5** w/ 4 page frames
	- Amount of page faults: 8 (bolds are faults)
		- 1,12,123
		- 1234
		- 1254
		- 1253
		- 1243
		- 5243
### Problems
- Reference string 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 w/ 4 page frames
	- This loop has 10 page faults, all of them.
	- In avg, this doesn't happen that often
### Straw Man LRU Implementations
- Stamp PTEs with timer value on access
	- Scan page table to find oldest counter value = LRU page
	- Problem: Would double memory traffic, O(n) search on eviction.
- Doubly-Linked List
	- On access remove page, place at tail of list
	- Problem: The list is going to take up lots of space
- We have to approximate LRU (which is an approximation of Belady's)
	- See \"Clock Algorithm LRU Approximation\"
## Most Recently Used (MRU)
- Evicting the page that has been used most recently (assumes that page is no longer used in the future)
## Clock Algorithm LRU Approximation
- aka second-chance replacement
- Use accessed bit supported by most hardware
	- e.g. Pentium will write 1 to A bit in PTE on first access
	- ![[Pasted image 20230309161723.png|150]]
	- Do FIFO but skip accessed pages
	- Keep pages in circular FIFO list
- Scan procedure (triggers on eviction):
	- page’s A bit = 1, set to 0 & skip
	- else if A = 0, evict
	- The hand moves and stays there until next eviction
- Large memory may be a problem
	- Add a second clock hand
		- Two hands move in lockstep (the gap between is fixed)
		- Leading hand clears (set 0) A bits
		- Trailing hand evicts pages with A=0
		- ![[Pasted image 20230309162658.png|150]]
		- Ex
			- ![[Pasted image 20230309162808.png|300]]
				- 1st: tail couldn't evict, keep going
				- 2nd: head cleaned, tail still couldn't evict
				- 3rd: finally, tail evicted, done with scan
- Implemented in OS kernel
## Other
- ![[Pasted image 20230309163350.png|300]]
	- LFU & MFU keeps count instead of time
		- Also use clock algorithm, but most commonly used
	- Random is bogo
## Fixed vs. Variable Space for Processes
- How to determine how much memory to give to each process?
### Fixed Space Algorithm
- Each process is given a limit of pages it can use
- When it reaches the limit, it replaces from its own pages
- Local replacement
	- Depending on the type of program, some processes may do well while others suffer
### Variable Space Algorithm
- Process’ set of pages grows and shrinks dynamically
- Global replacement
	- One process can ruin it for the rest, hoarding too many pages
#### Page Fault Frequency (PFF)
- Page Fault Frequency (PFF) is a variable space algorithm that uses a more ad-hoc approach
	- Monitor the fault rate for each process
	- If the fault rate is above a high threshold, give it more memory
		- To reduce faults, but it's not guaranteed (e.g. ties default to FIFO doing Belady’s Anomaly)
	- If the fault rate is below a low threshold, take away memory
		- To increase faults, but also not guaranteed too
