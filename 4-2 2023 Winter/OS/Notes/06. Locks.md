# Critical Section
- Without the implementation of CS (Critical Section) to enable Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230131160752.png|400]]
		- The yellow thread writes it last, negating blue's changes
	- We have to make sure that only 1 thread is inside a Critical Section
## Critical Section Requirements
-  Mutual exclusion (mutex)
	- If one thread is in the critical section, then no other is (safety property, something bad happens)
- Progress
	- If some thread T is not in the critical section, then T cannot prevent some other thread S from entering the critical section (liveness property, something good happens)
	- A thread in the critical section will eventually leave it
- Bounded waiting (no starvation)
	- If some thread T is waiting on the critical section, then T will eventually enter the critical section (liveness property)
- Performance
	- The overhead of entering and exiting the critical section is small with respect to the work being done within it
- Properties hold for each run, while performance depends on all the runs
	- Rule of Thumb: worry about safety first.
## Analogy: Too Much Milk, Try #1 – Leave a note
- ![[Pasted image 20230131161839.png|300]]
- Problem: (NOT SAFE)
	- A thread checks if milk == 0, then interrupts and leaves
	- Another thread comes in and completes and milk++
	- The old thread comes back, no note, so milk++ again
## Analogy: Too Much Milk, Try #2 – Leave 2 notes
- ![[Pasted image 20230131162514.png|150]]![[Pasted image 20230131162531.png|150]]
- Problem: NOT LIVENESS
	- Both can leave notes and get interrupted
	- When they come back, they will think the other person already both the milk, and milk never changes.
## Analogy: Too Much Milk, Try #3 – Monitoring Note
- ![[Pasted image 20230131162726.png|125]]![[Pasted image 20230131162739.png|125]]
- Problem: NOT PERFORMANT
	- Some wasted time checking the while loop, but this can get the job done as Alice is delay a bit by the while loop.
# Locks
- A way to implement Critical Sections
	- Lock the door, on the way in, and unlock on the way out. (Bathroom be like)
- A lock is an object in memory providing two operations
	- acquire(): wait until lock is free, then take it to enter a C.S.
	- release(): release lock to leave a C.S., waking up anyone waiting for it
	- Threads must pair these 2 operations, or there will be oopsies (eg infinite waiting)
## Using Locks in Balance
- ![[Pasted image 20230131163604.png|500]]
	- When green tries to apply the lock, it'll gets denied and waits.
	- Return is outside the critical section because the local scope variable in the stack, balance is isn't shared.
	- When a third thread calls acquire(), it'll also wait and is in a queue.
## Locking API
- ![[Pasted image 20230131165417.png|400]]
	- Define the lock and initialize it (line 1)
		- “lock” variable stores the state of the lock
		- init value is unlocked
	- Call the lock function (line 2)
		- acquiring the lock
	- Then unlock it when done (line 4) 
	- (The textbook uppercases the P, it is not like that in the real API)
## Locking Design
- Coarse-grained locking
	- One big lock is used any time any critical section is accessed
	- ![[Pasted image 20230131170926.png|250]]
	- Harder to create deadlocks, less overhead from context switch
- Fine-grained locking
	- Using different locks to protect different data and data structures
	- ![[Pasted image 20230131171126.png|200]]
	- Better concurrency, can have deadlocks if not careful, better fairness, more overhead context switching
# Implementing Locks
## Disabling Interrupts - Historical
- - One implementation of acquire/release is to disable interrupts:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230131171842.png|300]]
- This is not good nowadays as a multicore CPU can enter the Critical Section at the same time. (Interrupts is per core base)
	- Also, malicious process can never release execution, hanging system.
## Spinlock (Software)
- Sucks by wasting cycles and doesn't work
- ![[Pasted image 20230131172650.png|300]]
	- C review: -> is a struct field getter
	- We wait some cycles waiting at the while loop
- Still not safe
	- ![[Pasted image 20230131173125.png|300]]
		- Flag is shared, and isn't protected. Can be more than 2 threads going inside at once
		- Execution sequence that breaks lock
			- 1: Read
				- (interrupting 1) 2: Read
				- 2: Write
			- 1. Write
- There is no way for software to do flag protection
	- How do we stop the recursion?
	- The implementation of acquire/release must be atomic 
		- An atomic operation is one which executes as though it could not be interrupted 
		- Code that executes “all or nothing”
	- How do we make them atomic?
		- We need HW to help
			- i.e. ISA
		- test-and-set is a atomic instruction
## Test-And-Set (Software)
- Test it, and Set it
- ![[Pasted image 20230202154748.png|300]]
	- Record the old value
	- Set the value to indicate available
	- Return the old value
- By accessing the memory, you are utilizing an atomic instruction via HW memory
- When executing TestAndSet(&flag, 1) (locking)
	- The flag value afterwards is 1
	- The return value is either 0 if was unlocked before, and 1 if was locked before
### Test-And-Set w/ Spinlock Implementation
- ![[Pasted image 20230202155336.png|300]]
	- Use spinlock to check and wait for lock. 
		- The difference is that test-and-set makes use of HW memory transfer instead of leaving the flag as an exposed shared resource
- For multicore processors
	- This is still working
	- HW engineer better no mess up
- WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	- This is on SOFTWARE, IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T WORK
	- We need OS API in the kernel to access privileges to HW
### Evaluation
- Correctness
	- Yes, Spin locks with TestAndSet on HW guarantees critical sections won’t be executed simultaneously by (2) threads
- Fairing
	- No fairness guarantee.  Once a thread has a lock, nothing forces it to relinquish it
	- Starvation
- Performance
	- Wasted cycles while spinning (but we can actually tell the thread to yield())
		- ![[Pasted image 20230202162408.png|250]]
		- When yield() is called, the process locked out goes from running to ready.
		- The cost is no longer spinning, but context switching to threads to check locks.
		- Still able to starve
		- (Also, the original lock holder gives up CPU time because of involuntary interrupt timing)
## Fetch-and-Add
- ![[Pasted image 20230202163339.png|250]]
	- Instead of just reading, you also increment the flag
### Implementation
- ![[Pasted image 20230202163402.png|300]]
	- The lock needs fields ticket and turn.
		- Both initialized with 0
		- When on calls lock, the thread receives a ticket with the current number
		- On unlock, turn++ so that the next ticket number can run
		- Tickets and Turn can reach int's max, but it's probably not going to happen and is probably fine as overflow won't mean anything
			- Also, ticket $\leq$ turn
- This is Test-And-Set with a queue, so it's fair now.
