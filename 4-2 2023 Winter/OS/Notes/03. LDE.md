# OS with Direct Execution
- What if programs could directly control the CPU / system? (Ring 0 Kernel be like)
	- Very fast!
		- But without limits on running programs, the OS wouldn’t be in control of anything and would “just be a library”.
		- OS can't share time, security, or anything.
	- ![[Pasted image 20230112173302.png|300]]
- We need to find a balance

# LDE
-  Limited Direct Execution
	- When the process doesn't have direct control of the CPU
	- Useful for security and stability with dangerous program
- Tradeoff
	- Less Performance, but more Fairness & Security
- Limited direct execution means “only limited”  processes can execute DIRECTLY on the CPU in trusted mode
	- TRUSTED means the process is trusted, and it can do anything... (e.g. it is a system / kernel level process)
# How to Perform Restricted Operations?
- A user process must be able to perform I/O and other restricted operations, but without giving the process complete control over the system.
	- So we have a trusted middleman/layer
	- Customers (user processes) ask the teller (system calls of OS) to perform restricted operations on their behalf
- Both customer and teller are software programs; how does CPU tell the difference?
## Protected Control Transfer
- Hardware mode bit(s) facilitating protected control transfer
## CPU Modes
- Utilize CPU Privilege Rings (Intel x86, requires 2 bits)
	- \[highest\] rings 0 (kernel), 1 (Virtual Machine kernel), 2 (unused), 3 (user) \[lowest\]
		- User Mode (untrusted)
			- Application is running, but w/o direct I/O access
			- Some instructions and registers are disabled by the CPU, such as:
				- Exception Registers
				- HALT
				- MMU instructions (memory altering)
				- OS memory access
				- I/O device access
		- Kernel Mode (trusted)
			- OS kernel is running performing restricted operations directly on HW
			- All instructions and registers enabled
				- The kernel can do anything, even killing itself
## System Calls
- What should a user process do when it wishes to perform privileged operation, such as open a file or read from a file?
	- Perform a system calls.
		- Implemented as API (e.g. fork(), wait(), exec())
	- They implement restricted “OS” operations.
- Allow kernel exposes key functions through an API to user programs:
	- Device I/O (e.g., File I/O)
	- Task swapping: context switching between processes
	- Memory management/allocation: malloc()
	- Creating/destroying processes
### System Call Ex
- ![[Pasted image 20230117161246.png|350]]
	- We have to save the user mode's state and switch to kernel through Trap in order to do a System Call
		- Trap: any transfer to kernel mode
			- System call: (planned) as above
			- Exception: (error) div by zero, page fault
			- Interrupt: (event) keyboard event, timer ticks
## OS w/ LDE Boot Sequence
- ![[Pasted image 20230117162624.png|300]]
# Multitasking
- Multitasking was introduced >= Mac OSX, Windows 95+
- When one process is running on CPU, OS is not running
	- If OS is not running, how can it do anything at all?
- How/when should the OS regain control of the CPU to switch between processes?
## Cooperative Multitasking
- OS trusts processes (Old no longer used technique from 2nd generation (~Windows 95))
- Problems exist for regaining the control of the CPU w/ a Cooperative Multitasking OS
	- Programs will not give back control
		- bugs leading to crash or infinite loop, needing to reboot
		- selfishness
		- Malicious programs aren't checked
	- User programs can give up control of CPU through
		- Frequent system call
		- Periodical call of yield() system call
		- Illegal operations
## Timer interrupt 
- Replaced Cooperative Multitasking
- A timer interrupt gives OS the ability to run again on a CPU.
	- Timer is built into HW, usually one per core
	- Raised at some regular interval (in ms) to tell OS there's a chance if needed to regain control
	- Interrupt handling
		1. Current process is halted
		2. Process states are saved
		3. OS Interrupt handler is run (kernel mode)
### OS w/ LDE & Timer Interrupts
- ![[Pasted image 20230117171200.png|300]]
	- Context Switch using Timer Interrupt
		- Context Switch: save state of Process A, load and switch to Process B
	- A process doesn't always undergo a context switch every time it enters (trap) kernel mode from user mode
		- e.g. fork()
	- Context Switches types
		- Voluntary
			-  A blocking system call
				- wait()
				- yield()
				- I/O events
		- Involuntary
			- Timer Interrupts
			- Exception system calls
