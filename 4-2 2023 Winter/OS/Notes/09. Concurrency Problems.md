# Concurrency Bugs
- Some big data open-source software got research done on it to count concurrency bugs
	- ![[Pasted image 20230216155721.png|200]]
	- Distribution of concurrency bugs
		- ![[Pasted image 20230216155759.png|400]]
- 3 most common are
	- Data Race/Atomicity Violation: forgetting to synchronize
	- Order Violation: failure to initialize lock/condition before use
	- Deadlock: Locking order hangs the process
## Atomicity Violation
- Serialized access to shared memory among separate threads is not enforced (e.g. non-atomic)
- MySQL example
	- Two threads access the *proc_info* field in struct *thd*
	- ![[Pasted image 20230216160411.png|200]]
		- This noob didn't **lock a cuh**
## Order Violation Bugs
- Desired order between memory accesses is flipped (e.g. something is checked before it is set)
- Generic 2 Thread Example
	- ![[Pasted image 20230216160827.png|200]]
		- We need Thread1 then Thread2 to exec.
		- This noob forgot to use condition variable (and a paired lock & state variable) in order to **signal a cuh**
## Deadlock
- Incorrect use of synchronization (i.e. locks) can block all processes
	- e.g. If one process tries to access a resource that a second process holds, and vice-versa, they can never make progress
- Formally, Deadlock is a problem
	- When processes compete for access to limited resources
	- When processes are incorrectly synchronized
	- Deadlock exists among a set of processes if every processes or threads is waiting for an event that can be caused only by another process in the set.
### Deadlock Example
- ![[Pasted image 20230216162819.png|150]]
	- both lock and both waiting for the other to unlock.
- Same problem with condition variables
	- Suppose resource 1 managed by c1, resource 2 by c2  
	- A has 1, waits on c2, B has 2, waits on c1
### Deadlock IRL woah
- ![[Pasted image 20230216163103.png|300]]
	- One must back up, but that means the other cars behind must back up too, which is aids.
	- So there are 2 solutions
		- Prevent: during coding
		- Resolve: during runtime
### Deadlock and Thread Example
- A potential case is with cycles.
	- Thread 1 acquires lock L1, waits for lock L2
	- Thread 2 acquires lock L2, waits for lock L1
		- ![[Pasted image 20230216163925.png|200]]![[Pasted image 20230216163908.png|200]]
	- Both threads can block, unless one manages to acquire both locks
		- (Notice the reverse ordering between the 2, it's a way to detect deadlock)
### Deadlock Exercise
- Which ones can cause a deadlock?
- ![[Pasted image 20230216165754.png|350]]
	- \#2 is actually a solution to prevent deadlock
	- \#1 is detected by opposite order L1, L2 & L2, L1
	- \#3 is detected by seeing the cycle
# Deadlock Prevention
- Preventing deadlock before runtime
## Conditions for Deadlock
- ![[Pasted image 20230216172711.png|400]]
	- Deadlock occur when all conditions met.
### Preventing Mutual Exclusion Deadlock
- The Problem is that threads will claim exclusive control over resource they need.
- You can <u>eliminate all locks altogether</u> (just make threads -> processes 4head)
	- e.g. modern browsers where each tab is a process
	- **Very inefficient memory**
- You can build wait-free data structures
	- Using atomic CPU instruction (e.g. TestAndSet)
	- ACTUALLY, you can't generally use it because your implementation requires OS dependent API for concurrency
### Preventing Hold-and-Wait Deadlock
- The problem is that you need to acquire all locks atomically
- You can <u>lock a lock</u> (aka guard lock)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230216173628.png|150]]
	- Effective, **but makes concurrency obsolete**
### Preventing No Preemption Deadlock
- The problem is that resources can't be forcefully removed
- You can use a <u>timed lock</u>, with try lock. Makes usage into intervals (API: pthread_mutex_timedlock & pthread_mutex_trylock)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230216173846.png|200]]
	- Not a good solution, as bad timing can create live lock 
		- live lock: if 2 threads lock at "the same time", it will not make any progress that try
		- We can solve it though by adding a random small delay between threads locking, **making this a potential solution**
### Preventing Circular Wait Deadlock
- Provide total ordering of lock acquisition throughout code
	- aka, <u>always acquire locks in same order</u>
		- i.e. L1, L2, L3 and never mix up the order
- Works, **but you as the programmer must manage it with logic**, prone to bug if you suck at coding
### Preventing Deadlock by Intelligent Scheduling
- Consider this scenario:
	- 4 Threads (T1, T2, T3, T4) & 2 Locks (L1, L2)
	- Lock requirements of threads:
		- ![[Pasted image 20230221160153.png|300]]
		- These threads can create a deadlock (reversed order deadlock)
	- An <u>Intelligent Scheduler would pick this as the thread runtime order</u>
		- ![[Pasted image 20230221160347.png|200]]
			- No deadlock (T2 runs after T1 on the same core, which is the threads that uses same locks)
- Consider another scenario
	- 4 Threads (T1, T2, T3, T4) & 2 Locks (L1, L2)
		- ![[Pasted image 20230221160525.png|300]]
	- The best scheduling is
		- CPU1: T4
		- CPU2: T1, T2, T3
			- This is downgrading 
- In the end, **an intelligent scheduler ordering is not automatically generated**. There has to be some compilation to determine the thread ordering. This is a **historical prevention method**
# Deadlock Resolve
- During runtime, fix deadlocks
## Detect and Recover
- Allow deadlocks to occasionally occur
	- For interactive system, hopefully this doesn't often happen
	- For servers and databases, it's more forgiving, so a lot of them employ this strategy
### Resource Allocation Graph
- ![[Pasted image 20230221161421.png|300]]
	- This is just to help visualize deadlock
#### Examples
- ![[Pasted image 20230221161602.png|150]]
	- P1 is requesting R1
	- P2 is holding R1
	- P2 is requesting R3
	- P3 is holding R3
	- There is no loop, there is not a possibility for a deadlock (just do topological sorting cycle check 4head kinda)
- ![[Pasted image 20230221162603.png|150]]      ![[Pasted image 20230221162756.png|150]] 
	- This has a deadlock. There are a cycle for each R2 instance
- ![[Pasted image 20230221162706.png|170]]
	- This doesn't have a deadlock because only one cycle for 2 R2 instances
### Steps
- Traverse the resource graph looking for cycles
- If a cycle is found, preempt resource (force a process to release)
	- BRUH MOMENT! In real systems, a resource usually only have one instance, so one cycle is enough to determine a deadlock
		- BFS, DFS, or Topological Sorting cycle detect
			- Expensive to search through the whole graph
			- We run the detection in intervals
				- The best time is based on trial and error, measuring performance of different times, depending on the system and program task
