# Condition Variables
- There are many cases where a thread wants to wait for another thread before proceeding with execution.
	- join() is a way, but then the thread disappears afterwards and the sequence of execution isn't enforced.
- We can use Condition Variables to tell threads that they can execute given the current condition.
- A condition variable is associated with a condition needed for a thread to make progress
	- Support a signaling mechanism to alert threads when preconditions have been satisfied
		- Threads are placed on an explicit queue (FIFO) to wait for signals / conditions
			- The thread is blocked/waiting (or let it spin if you are ugly)
			- Allows for fairness in execution
- It's like fork() & wait() but for threads
## Example: Spin
- ![[Pasted image 20230209165637.png|320]]
	- *done* is a State Variable (just some variable to show what state/step the program is in)
		- The child thread spins and waits until *done* != 0
	- Sucks because wasted cycles, and *done* is not protected
# Condition Variables API
- This is actually a queue of threads.
	- Needs to be paired with a mutex lock.
	- Usually paired with a state variable
- Initialization: "Pthread_cond_t c;"
	- Just made a one called c
- Condition variables support three operations:
	-  ![[Pasted image 20230209170713.png|500]]
	- Wait – release lock, wait for C/V to be signaled (get put in queue)
		- assumes the lock is held when wait() is called
		- puts caller to sleep + releases the lock (atomically)
		- when awoken, reacquires the lock before returning
	- Signal – wakeup one waiting thread (wake up the first in queue)
		- wake a single waiting thread (if >= 1 thread is waiting)
		- if there is no waiting thread,, just return w/o doing anything
	- Broadcast – wakeup all waiting threads
## Example: No Lock
![[Pasted image 20230209172643.png|500]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230209172506.png|250]]
	- This example sucks because *done* isn't protected.
		- The parent can exec all the way into while, get interrupted, and the child then sends the signal to no one. When the parent gets to run again, it'll wait forever
## Example: Correctly Used Conditional Variable
- ![[Pasted image 20230209172839.png|250]]
	- Unlike above, the *done* is protected by a mutex lock.
	- *Cond_wait(&c, &m)* unlocks the lock automatically from us passing in *&m*, which is the lock.
	- When main wakes up again, it unlocks the already unlocked lock, and that's fine.
# Producer/Consumer
- ![[Pasted image 20230214154151.png|300]]
- Producer: Produces items to the buffer
	- e.g. a child matrix maker or creates A* list
	- Needs memory (slots in the buffer) to keep producing
- Consumer: Grabs data out of the buffer
	- e.g. calculates average value of a matrix or reads A* list and move
	- Needs stuff in the buffer to consume
## Bounded Buffer
- "Bounded" is from the limited memory, the buffer is fixed.
- Problem: There is a set of resource buffers shared by producer and consumer threads
	- Producer inserts resources into the buffer set (e.g. output, disk blocks, memory pages, processes, etc.)
	- Consumer removes resources from the buffer set (i.e. whatever is made by producer)
- Producer and consumer execute at different rates
	- Because each are different threads, the OS decides which runs, we can't rely on a balanced timing.
	- No serialization of one behind the other
	- Tasks are independent (easier to think about)
- Safety:  Sequence of consumed values is prefix of sequence of produced values
	- Via the time stamps, we can create a queue
	- We also need to protect the queue (locks)
	- The queue size is fix to not exhaust memory
## Put/Get Routines
- Buffer is a shared integer
- Producer puts data in the buffer int, the consumer gets it.
- There's also a count, 0 means empty, 1 means there's something in there.
- ![[Pasted image 20230214160318.png|350]]
	- When the producer puts into the int, it checks if it is 0 first.
	- When the consumer gets the int, it checks if it is 1 first.
## Example: Producer/Consumer
- 2 Threads, 1 Producer & 1 Consumer
- Uses Puts/Gets above
- ![[Pasted image 20230214160539.png|300]]
	- Producer tries to put stuff into the buffer, the Consumer tries to read it.
	- This sucks because we don't have any locks, Producer and Consumer can get interrupted before finishing both Read and Write stages.
## Example: Producer/Consumer w/ Locks
- ![[Pasted image 20230214160901.png|400]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230214161403.png|400]]
	- Now it's protected, we have a working integer buffer, but only for 1 Producer and 1 Consumer only.
	- With 1 Producer and 2 Consumers
		- ![[Pasted image 20230214162839.png|400]]  
		-  To fix this, we need to change if statement on line 20 & 8 to a while loop (spinlock type beat) because when producer threads awake, they do not check if there is any data in the buffer
			- ![[Pasted image 20230214164605.png|200]]
			- This is not a full fix yet, we don't know which one to wake up to properly fix the problem.
				- ![[Pasted image 20230214164706.png|350]]
				- With only one condition variable, C1, C2, and P gets enqueued in the same queue, we don't have a way to signal the producer to start producing more.
## Example: Producer/Consumer w/ Locks & 2 Condition Variables
- With 2 condition variables, we can have 
	- the consumers signal the producer to make more
	- the producers to signal to the next consumer to eat
-  e.g. Use two condition variables: empty & full
	- ![[Pasted image 20230214165626.png|350]]
# Final Producer/Consumer Example
## Puts/Gets
- ![[Pasted image 20230214170040.png|200]]
	- Wow, so high tech, our puts and gets have a buffer array now.
	- We also have a modulo so that we don't shift values around (scuffed LinkedList be like).
		- This is why count is useful, keep track of the size.
			- Also count <= MAX is checked by producer and consumer
## Producer/Consumer
- ![[Pasted image 20230214165647.png|350]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230214165658.png|350]]
	- Producers tries to fill up array until MAX, then signals Consumer and sleeps
	- Consumers tries to eat everything until 0, then signals Producers and sleeps
	- Also, 2 Condition Variables, each for Producer and Consumer
		- Producer waits for empty CV, which is signaled by Consumers
		- Consumers wait for full CV, which is signaled by Producers
# Assignment 2 Notes
- We have an array buffer of Matrices
- Producers must create Matrices
- Consumers eat the Matrices to do math on it
- 1P & 1C
	- Use given pseudocode
- 2P & 2C
	- Can't use for loops anymore
	- Needs a global *count* for Puts/Gets
- 3P & 3C
	- Similar to 2P & 2C
