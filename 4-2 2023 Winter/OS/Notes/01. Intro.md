# What's an OS?
- It the bridge between apps and hardware / facilitates the interaction between.
- OS today manages multiple processes (multitasking).
- OS manages memory between processes (virtual memory)
- So in summary, it's a resource manager.
	- CPU, Memory, I/O (Storage, Network, etc.)
# How to Share
## Virtualization
- The OS presents an illusion that each user program runs in isolation on its own hardware.
- The virtual form is abstract
	- CPU: Processes and/or Threads
	- Memory: Address Space
	- Disk: Files
### CPU Virtualization
- Each running program gets its own “virtual” representation of the CPU.
	- Many programs seem to run at once
		- One process per CPU at a time (because registers)
			- OS schedules process to run
	- Even though we have 4 instances of a program, OS makes it execute at the same time (perceptively)
	- So OS shares CPU's time
#### Example
- Simple Looping C Program
	- It loops indefinitely
	- We can run 2 program of this, it will run concurrently
		- It display it at the same time, in the same order each time
		- We have to kill each with a new terminal
- Concurrency example
	- 2 Threads, each repeating $n$ times adding 1 to a counter both shares
	- $n$ = 10000, it works fine ending with 20000
	- $n$ = 100000 breaks and the count is less than 200000
		- There is a Read, Update, and Write loop when executing in each thread. The problem is that the counter is not finished being written to by one thread, and the other is already reading
		- How do we mitigate the problem without reverting to sequential?
### Memory Virtualization
- Each process (program) has its own virtual address space
	- Sandbox Virtual Address Space mapped to Physical Address Space
		- The mapping now is done via paging and can be fragmented (back then like 8086, it's blocks)
- The OS maps virtual address spaces onto the physical memory
- A memory reference from one process can not affect the address space of others
- So OS shares RAM's space (and also protects)
#### Example
- Malloc
	- You malloc an int into the heap.
	- When you print out the address of the int, the address given is the Virtual one.
	- If you run two processes of this concurrently
		- The output of each can (usually is different by default option) still be the same Virtual Address
			- The Physical Address is always different
### I/O Virtualization
- Read or Write. I/O devices vary a lot, and the OS is bridge for the software to just call simple operations instead of needed to name the specific section of a disk (and other crap for other types).
