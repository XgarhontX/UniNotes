# This Reference for Anonymous Functions
- When you declare an anonymous function and want to access "this" object,
- You need to declare a function local variable (var that = this) so that the anonymous function can access the real "this" object
----
class AssetManager {

	downloadAll(callback) {
		var that = this;
		img.addEventListener("load", function () {
		    console.log("Loaded " + this.src);
		    that.successCount++;
		    if (that.isDone()) callback(); //that refers to the AssetManager instance
		});
	}
}

-----------
- Or you can replace "function ()" with "() =>", creating an anonymous function but the scope is maintained the same, allowing you to skip "that = this"
# Action Listeners
- Use HTML Image events to report when an image is done downloading.
	- Loaded event
	- Error event
- Then execute the callback function to continue the program.
