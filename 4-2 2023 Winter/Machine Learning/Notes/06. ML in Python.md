- Array, Matrix, DataFrame?
	- An vector is a 1-D collection, either a list, a set, numpy.array, or even a pandas.series
	- A matrix is typically a 2-D collection of rows and columns such as a nested list, a numpy.array or a pandas.DataFrame
	- Older conversion methods are decrepit. Use df.to_numpy()
- (method-ish) df\['SalePrice'\].head(5)) returns a DataFrame that only has the 'SalePrice' column
