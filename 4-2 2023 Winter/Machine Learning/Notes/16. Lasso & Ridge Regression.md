# Lasso & Ridge Regression
- Let $y$ = the weighted sum of all attributes, $\sum x_i * w_i$
- Error = Sum of (actual $y$ - predicted $y$)$^2$ + Regularization
	- Lasso Regularization: $\lambda \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}|w_i|$
	- Ridge Regularization: $\lambda \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}(w_i)^2$
		- and $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter to play with the strength of regularization.
