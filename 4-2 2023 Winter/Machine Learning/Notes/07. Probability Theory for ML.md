# Random Variables and Probability Distributions
## Random Variables
- A random variable is a variable that can take on different values randomly.
- Ex:
	- A random variable called $\text{Gender}$ can be male or female.
	- A random variable called $\text{HoursWorked}$ can take on the value < 40.5 or ≥ 40.5
	- A random variable called $\text{BodyTemp}$ can take any values in \*F (continuous)
- We assume the random variable is discrete unless stated otherwise
## Probability Mass Function
- To indicate how likely it is for a discrete random variable $X$ to take on each of its values, one uses a probability mass function (PMF) $P$
- This is a function that maps each value $x$ that $X$ can take on, to a number between 0 and 1, written as $P(x)$. By definition, a probability mass function $P$ on a random variable $X$ must satisfy the following properties:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125170148.png|400]]
	- $P$ is defined w.r.t. $X$, but $P$ doesn't have a letter to reference $X$.
		- With one random variable is fine.
		- But with multiple variables, we shouldn't write $P(x)$, 
			- but $P(X=x)$ to denote the probability that $X$ has value $x$
			- and $P(X)$ instead of $P$
		- So when $P$ is the probability distribution of the random variable $X$, then
			- $P(X) = P$
			- $P(X=x) = P(x)$
## Table 1
- ![[Pasted image 20230125172740.png|275]]
	- $P(\text{Gender})$
		- $P(\text{Gender=male}) =$ $0.3313+0.0972+0.1341+0.1059$ $=0.6685$
		- $P(\text{Gender=female}) =$ sum of other rows $=0.3315$
	- $P(\text{HoursWork})$
		- $P(\text{Wealth=rich}) = 0.2393$ (same thing, add the rows where variable = rich)
		- $P(\text{Wealth=poor}) = 0.7607$
## Joint probability distribution
- PMF can act on multiple variables
	- $P(X,Y)$ 
	- $P(X=x,Y=y)= P(x,y)$
- Ex: 
	- $P(\text{Gender, HoursWorked, Wealth}) = 0.2531$
## Marginal Probability Distribution
- A joint probability distribution is very rich in information. 
- We can use it to compute the probability distribution of each subset of its variables by means of the law of total probability:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125175831.png|225]]
		- Summation is over all values $y$ in random variable $Y$
- With 3 variables
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125180042.png|300]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125180119.png|400]]
- Ex:
	- We can calculate $P(Gender = female, Wealth = rich) = 0.0246+0.0116 = 0.0362$
	- We can do for the other values
		- ![[Pasted image 20230125181131.png|150]]
	- Sum this new table's rows & column, and we can marginal probability distribution for both Gender and Wealth.

# Conditional Probabilities and Bayes’ Rule
![[Pasted image 20230125203851.png|300]]
## Conditional Probabilities Distribution
- The conditional probability that $Y = y$ given $X = x$ is written as $P(Y = y |X = x)$ and defined as
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125182044.png|250]]
	- Only defined when $P(X = x) > 0$
- Alternatively
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125203124.png|115]]
### Exercise 3.1 
- ![[Pasted image 20230125181131.png|150]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125193933.png|300]]
## Bayes' Rule
- We can reverse the roles of X and Y
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125182158.png|250]]
	- Only defined when $P(Y = x) > 0$
- So, 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125182234.png|325]]
- Also  
	- because ![[Pasted image 20230125182851.png|250]], we can replace $P(X = x | Y = y)$
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125183600.png|400]] (**<u>Bayes' Rule</u>**)
	- or shorthand:
		- ![[Pasted image 20230125183626.png|200]]
- Alternatively
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125202202.png|200]]
## Law of Total Probability (Sum Rule)
- Earlier we said
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125175831.png|200]]
- With Bayes' Rule, we can say that
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125183747.png|300]]
- Alternatively: (X is A, Y is B, and there's 3 Bs)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125202633.png|300]]
## Chain Rule (product rule)
- If we replace the probability distribution of $X$ by the joint probability distribution of random variables $X_1$ and $X_2$, we obtain
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125184158.png|400]] (**<u>most usable for hand calculation</u>**)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125184218.png|500]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125184236.png|600]]
- In general, any joint probability distribution over many random variables can be decomposed like this into conditional distributions over only one variable.
	- ![[Pasted image 20230125185238.png|300]]
	- (aka the chain rule allows us to rewrite a joint probability distribution as a product of conditional probability distributions)
