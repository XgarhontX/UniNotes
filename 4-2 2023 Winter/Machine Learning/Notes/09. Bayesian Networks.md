# Bayesian Learning
- You are given values for input attributes $A_1$, $A_2$,... $A_n$
- Goal is to infer a value for target attribute $C$
- Bayesian Learning wants to infer $C$ based on the highest probability
# Bayesian Network
- Since Naive Bayes Classifier assumptions all attributes' conditional probability are independent.
- A Bayesian Network is a way to account for dependent conditional probability

## Bayesian Network VS Decision Tree
- Bayesian Network
	- Inference, Structure Learning, Parameter Learning
- Decision Tree
	- Classification of a test instance, Learning shape of a tree, Learning value of threshold
